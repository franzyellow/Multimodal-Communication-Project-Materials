Utterance,Start,End,Group,Participant,Transcript
0,2.9,5.15,7,4,I need to callibrate my cameras first
1,13.67,16.67,7,4,Okay um and if you could flip that paper over for me
2,18,19.5,7,4,There will be content on that paper
3,22.25,25.23,7,4,Okay the task that you are completing is called the weights task
4,26,30.25,7,4,In part one you will work together to determine the weights of the five colorable cubes
5,30.9,33.5,7,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
6,34.59,37.83,7,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here
7,39.33,43.58,7,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams so you don't need to touch the slider on the scale
8,44.08,49.58,7,4,The scale is not perfect so as long as one side doesn't drop down you can assume that the weights are equal
9,50.58,56.08,7,4,Uh you will place the blocks onto these onto the worksheet once you have determined their weight
10,56.84,59.08,7,4,And you will also enter the weight into this survey here
11,59.47,62.31,7,4,You guys are going to be group number seven and you can go ahead and get started
12,63.87,66.17,7,3,Do I just type in the group number now or
13,65.91,66.01,7,4,Yeah
14,74,74.25,7,3,Okay
15,78.34,80.09,7,2,Let's start with the smallest block
16,93.75,94.25,7,3,Yeah.
17,94.5,95.75,7,1,Yeah almost
18,98.5,101.75,7,3,I think so as well or I think it's the other way around uh
19,105.34,105.84,7,3,Yeah
20,107.08,107.34,7,1,Okay
21,107.31,109.09,7,2,It seems to be ten
22,110.32,111.14,7,3,Yeah uh
23,112.42,114.67,7,2,Is that blue or purple this is blue I guess
24,114.41,115.17,7,3,This is blue
25,116.42,118.12,7,3,And this was ten
26,118.63,119.11,7,3,Okay
27,119.25,123.5,7,2,and we can now we have twenty so we can try to put one of them
28,123.53,123.75,7,3,Sure
29,125.75,127.5,7,3,Oh that's the heaviest
30,128.54,129.82,7,2,Oh this seems to heavy
31,130.34,130.53,7,1,Oh
32,130.82,131.31,7,3,Okay
33,136.92,138.42,7,1,Think it should be
34,139.87,142.15,7,3,Yeah they should be twenty as well
35,145.93,146.25,7,3,Okay
36,147.5,149,7,3,Should I put this as twenty
37,148.95,149.25,7,1,Yeah
38,149.74,150.25,7,1,Green
39,151.5,151.75,7,3,Okay
40,152.57,153.59,7,1,Now it's forty
41,154.52,155.09,7,3,And
42,155.75,156.25,7,1,This is
43,157.59,158.81,7,2,You can try I'm always
44,159.06,160.01,7,1,No no no that's silly
45,160.86,161.59,7,2,I think that's heavier
46,162.17,163.67,7,1,This one or this one
47,163.58,164.92,7,2,eh that one is lighter yeah
48,179.32,181.84,7,3,Yeah I think it's yeah thirty
49,180.82,181.31,7,1,Thirty
50,184.42,184.62,7,3,Yup
51,186.92,187.13,7,3,Okay
52,189.61,190.17,7,3,Ummm
53,192.91,194.92,7,2,So is twenty and there is thirty
54,202.58,204.82,7,2,so is twenty plus
55,205.32,205.84,7,1,Thirty
56,207.51,211.07,7,2,So it's not exactly aligning but it could be
57,209.84,211.02,7,3,No no no no
58,212.15,212.86,7,3,So if we
59,212.92,213.95,7,2,Fifty I guess
60,217.42,217.92,7,3,No
61,226.5,228.62,7,3,Yeah I think fifty seems right
62,227.54,229.59,7,2,Fifty and the purple is
63,230.35,232.05,7,2,Thirty thirty plus twenty
64,233.54,233.85,7,3,Yup
65,234.84,235.34,7,1,Yeah
66,236.42,244.67,7,3,Fifty oh purple is thirty yellow
67,239.45,242.67,7,1,I'm sorry It purple is thirty
68,243,246.17,7,2,Uh it's not exactly aligning should I
69,246.75,251,7,2,So this seem it's little more yeah so should I put something here
70,248.75,249.25,7,3,On the left
71,250,252.09,7,1,Do you want to put ten it is
72,252.81,254.33,7,3,We can try it yeah
73,256.03,256.33,7,2,No
74,256.53,256.88,7,3,No
75,257.09,259.34,7,1,I should we should keep ten see
76,260.24,262.17,7,2,But then that'll even this is
77,263.17,264.67,7,2,This is ten ok we know that this is ten
78,265.14,273.75,7,3,Yeah no it's still on the left
79,267.67,270,7,2,Yeah but we put both ten so that they cancel out
80,269.75,272.25,7,1,Now it's completely now
81,276.75,277.5,7,3,You mean like this
82,279.04,281.05,7,2,So this is thirty oops sorry
83,281.26,284.54,7,3,Thirty and then yeah
84,281.33,282.84,7,2,Thirty plus thirty plus  
85,284.59,285.17,7,2,Fifty
86,285.41,285.67,7,3,Yeah
87,297.75,298.75,7,3,So
88,300.75,304,7,1,It's okay or we should just us scale it with this one
89,303.75,307.32,7,3,Yeah how about we try like twenty and then
90,313.42,316.42,7,1,It's it's two gram I think
91,316.67,318.92,7,1,It has until five but
92,321.25,322.25,7,1,we can
93,323.17,325.75,7,3,Yeah it's I don't know
94,323.5,324.56,7,2,What does this do
95,326.75,328.5,7,1,It's five gram now
96,328.84,334.82,7,1,It's mmm it's this way plus five so you can
97,333.07,333.33,7,3,Oh
98,340.08,341.85,7,3,Oh ok so it could be
99,342.16,344.42,7,1,So you should add something here
100,347.25,347.5,7,3,Or here
101,347.42,350,7,2,So now we're adding three grams where
102,351.75,353.25,7,3,So we're adding
103,356,357.58,7,2,Where are we adding so wait
104,358.33,363.17,7,3,So if you move it there then we're adding like five grams yeah to that one
105,360.42,362.57,7,1,Going to this one yeah
106,361.42,361.92,7,2,There
107,363.42,369.92,7,2,No so it's divided it's two point five and two point five so it can't be other five that's not how it works
108,371.42,372.67,7,2,So uh
109,372.58,375.42,7,3,So is it to the right right now like the scale
110,378.21,381.52,7,3,Like the center scale is it to the right okay so
111,380,385.92,7,2,Yeah are we allowed to ask questions
112,381.25,383.56,7,1,But it doesn't have any
113,387.15,389.14,7,3,I don't are we allowed to ask questions or no
114,388.65,393.42,7,4,To clarify you don't need to use the slider at all they will all be in intervals of ten grams
115,394,395.75,7,3,Oh okay so
116,394.03,397.25,7,1,Ah yeah because yeah so it's fifty
117,396.5,399,7,2,So now we've kind of destructed everything
118,399.25,399.75,7,3,Okay
119,403.33,406.84,7,3,So if it's an interval of ten it should be forty but
120,408.33,411.34,7,3,It's more balanced with fifty grams
121,419.25,425.75,7,3,Oops oh I don't know yeah I think so
122,422,425.44,7,2,Fifty fifty
123,429,432,7,3,Otherwise uh like it wasn't balanced with
124,431.52,432.33,7,1,It's slightly off
125,433.33,435.05,7,2,It's slightly to the left that's what it
126,436.02,436.17,7,3,Yeah
127,438.41,441.62,7,3,But like the scale isn't properly aligned as well so
128,441.41,444.42,7,2,It could be forty but can we measure forty
129,445.5,448.5,7,3,So so green
130,445.67,449.42,7,2,So that is thirty plus ten so that is purple
131,450.5,452.75,7,2,Purple plus red I guess
132,452.33,452.84,7,3,Okay
133,457.21,458.84,7,2,No Okay I think it's fifty
134,457.83,459.81,7,3,No Okay
135,461.12,462.14,7,3,Yeah uh
136,469.42,476.25,7,3,Yeah I think so so red ten Yeah
137,470.13,477,7,2,That is correct Yellow is fifty Purple was thirty Blue is ten
138,478.31,478.37,7,1,Kay
139,479.57,482.33,7,3,Update your worksheet and
140,489.67,489.92,7,3,And
141,491.91,492.67,7,3,Green was
142,494.42,496.14,7,3,Twenty and purple was thirty
143,497.71,498,7,3,Yep
144,500.25,500.75,7,3,We're done
145,513.63,517.17,7,4,Okay you will now determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale
146,517.67,520.41,7,4,You will have two attempts and you can now begin the survey
147,520.91,521.42,7,3,Okay
148,523.66,524.75,7,2,Without using
149,525.95,526,7,3,Like
150,528,529,7,3,Feels weird to me around
151,530,533.5,7,2,Maybe um maybe first you can try don't say it aloud
152,534.15,537.66,7,2,You can try it don't say it aloud so that we don't biased
153,537.92,539.61,7,3,Okay yeah
154,538.42,538.92,7,1,Okay
155,543,543.25,7,3,I can start
156,543.21,546,7,2,Should we turn or something so that we don't biased
157,546.75,549.5,7,2,Should we as well I don't we won't look
158,558.08,561.25,7,2,So is it also in like multiples of ten the weight
159,561.66,561.71,7,4,Yes
160,593.42,600.5,7,1,Do you need help Ok you go
161,594.91,610.14,7,3,I don't know like could somebody else like try Ok I can yeah I think we have like two attempts to tell it to you yeah
162,600.75,602.82,7,2,ok you both try not to look so that
163,610.42,611.66,7,4,Oh you'll input it into the survey
164,611.32,613.92,7,3,Okay so like we can discuss it amongst ourselves
165,615.38,618.67,7,3,Like we have to input it here so there will be like two tries
166,619.92,620.62,7,2,eh okay
167,621,630.5,7,3,Yes No no we can like talk about it amongst ourselves we just have like two tries to like fill it in
168,622,624,7,1,So it's this last try
169,644.41,646.5,7,2,Yellow is fifty right
170,646.08,646.66,7,3,Yeah
171,666.16,668.75,7,2,I think this is seventy
172,670.25,674.75,7,3,Do you want to like it felt more heavier to me I don'­t know
173,675.52,676.09,7,2,More than seventy
174,676.58,679.09,7,3,Yeah like I tried it with all the blocks
175,679.11,683.56,7,2,Maybe um picking like this might also help
176,685.01,687.84,7,2,because you are distributing with three fingers
177,687.11,689.92,7,1,What about put it on one finger
178,691.15,692.13,7,1,Two finger
179,691.92,692.44,7,3,Yeah
180,694.66,698.12,7,2,It's like difficult I'll have to place it for you maybe
181,706.84,708.33,7,1,I think I need more
182,709.41,712.66,7,3,Okay uh Purple was heavier than green
183,714.94,717.25,7,1,I think they are equal yeah
184,716.66,717.42,7,2,Now it's equal
185,719,722.66,7,2,So this is uh thirty plus purple is
186,722.25,723.75,7,3,Uh yellow was fifty
187,726.5,729,7,3,And this was twenty And this was thirty
188,731.83,740.16,7,2,So this is eighty okay So what do you think How did you hold it
189,733.03,741.16,7,3,Yeah I think I thought like even all of these combined were Like this
190,741.92,743.75,7,2,Like that like on three fingers
191,742.42,744.13,7,3,Yes like yep
192,747.25,748,7,2,Okay so 
193,750.5,752.5,7,3,Yeah like this seems more
194,752.75,758.83,7,2,One two three fingers I guess it might matter which fingers we're holding with I don't know
195,758.08,760.84,7,3,Yeah like how about you try and
196,766.16,767.42,7,2,Oh maybe I'll try holding it here
197,767.66,768.16,7,3,Okay
198,773.25,774.5,7,2,It kinda feels the same
199,775,778.75,7,2,Can you put it on my these two fingers
200,783.81,787.81,7,3,Yeah Yeah maybe using three would be better
201,793.25,793.43,7,3,Yeah
202,802.57,803.59,7,1,Because I think
203,805.09,817.33,7,2,It's very difficult I don'­t know what side it is Like if you pick it up like this so this is why I felt it is seventy is because I was holding it like this 
204,806.59,812.33,7,1,Because it's not just when we weighed it's not just the weight it's could be
205,817.67,821.16,7,2,But now it does feel heavier actually now that you mention it
206,821.5,822,7,3,Yeah
207,824.5,829.84,7,1,So how about those two I had Eh these two
208,829.05,832,7,3,Uh Green was Twenty this is thirty this is fifty
209,838.09,839.33,7,2,Yeah still feels heavier
210,839.42,839.92,7,3,Yeah
211,841.66,841.91,7,3,How about
212,843.87,846.41,7,2,Is there a better way to measure it
213,847.39,853.16,7,3,Like if we were just measuring like one block we could just drop it to the ground the heavier one would fall first
214,854.21,854.42,7,3,Yeah
215,854.33,856.58,7,1,Or juggling like this
216,856.61,857.58,7,3,Yeah but uh
217,866.83,869.15,7,3,So you said eighty and you think
218,869.42,873.5,7,2,no I said seventy but now it could be more I don'­t know
219,869.66,871,7,1,I think it should be 
220,874.25,880.54,7,2,Actually feel this is equal to the combined weight of all of this now Is there
221,883.09,884.83,7,2,Is there for which part of the hand is more sensitive
222,886.33,890.09,7,3,Like it's generally this one
223,891.16,892.56,7,3,Like the palm I think
224,897.25,899.02,7,2,This feels very heavy okay
225,901.25,904.75,7,3,How about you hold this in one hand and what we'll do is like
226,905.33,907.58,7,2,Can we like use a string
227,909.33,910.09,7,2,No but we can't
228,912.33,913.66,7,3,Oh sorry no go ahead
229,914.41,925.16,7,3,So what if you like put this in one hand and we like had move like one block from like the other hand to this hand and see if whether it becomes heavier or lighter
230,927.09,927.75,7,3,Uh Okay
231,933.5,939.33,7,3,So Yeah I'll put this here
232,939.91,942.58,7,2,I don'­t think the palm is the most sensitive
233,942.09,942.15,7,3,No
234,943.68,948.66,7,2,So if there was a way to hold it like this I think this is more sensitive
235,949,949.27,7,3,Okay
236,950.94,952.93,7,2,This is definitely heavier I feel like
237,955,956.33,7,3,Uh I would right now
238,958.09,977.5,7,1,I forgot the name of that but in the physic when you have eight under um larger area what was that Sorry Uh no no the name of that in the physic Perhaps I can see the
239,968.16,981.5,7,3,Uh pressure Uh oh Uh I don'­t think we can we use our phones or
240,969.16,971.5,7,2,Surface area surface area
241,980.85,984.61,7,1,At least I want to see a word No it's okay
242,986.58,990.18,7,1,Density yeah I think density
243,988.01,988.23,7,3,Yeah
244,995.5,997.54,7,2,It could be the same can you try it now or
245,999,1006.09,7,2,So I uh maybe I'll try removing weights and I'll add also weights and then we can try to callibrate
246,1004.28,1006.54,7,3,Okay yeah yeah
247,1013.71,1015.18,7,2,Just keep trying different things
248,1014.45,1017.72,7,3,Yeah now like this is heavier yeah
249,1019.49,1020.47,7,3,Seems closer
250,1023.78,1032.59,7,2,I think we should try very fast so that you become more aware before you get used to it Then how about this
251,1026.36,1032.25,7,3,Yeah yup uh I don't know uh
252,1035.92,1040.61,7,3,I think good yard uh yeah this one
253,1041.46,1043.14,7,3,So this seems similar as well
254,1045.66,1047.71,7,3,Close enough uh
255,1048.48,1055.37,7,3,Yeah so like when you add like the red and blue I don't think it makes that much of a difference but
256,1055.79,1057.98,7,2,So it's definitely this much
257,1057.33,1062.09,7,3,But it could be this much or like with like
258,1062.11,1070.82,7,2,Like plus or minus Do you want to try that So hold it like that because it's more sensitive
259,1063.59,1067.21,7,3,Yeah Yeah Yeah like they're so
260,1068.42,1068.59,7,1,Okay
261,1072.52,1076.53,7,2,Um Okay I'll be adding and removing very quickly so
262,1087.23,1091.23,7,3,Yeah try to hold it like a bit higher I think like Yeah
263,1089.95,1091.73,7,2,Yeah don'­t rest your wrists yeah
264,1095.27,1095.59,7,1,Yeah
265,1098,1099.59,7,1,This just fits me
266,1106.1,1106.79,7,1,It's heavier
267,1111.67,1118.21,7,1,I think all of them Yeah I think it's between these two
268,1113.54,1115.94,7,2,Is it the same or now what do you feel
269,1118.73,1119.82,7,2,Between these two
270,1119.42,1122.47,7,1,Yeah because when you put could you put that on
271,1119.71,1120.26,7,3,Okay
272,1123.98,1127.97,7,1,When you put yeah when you put this one its heavier
273,1128.34,1132.67,7,3,Uh the red one Oh yeah uh no Okay so it's like either all of these or with blue
274,1129.68,1135.99,7,1,the blue the blue Now it's they are they feel same
275,1131.03,1131.62,7,2,both are ten each
276,1140.04,1144.92,7,1,Yeah Do you want to try that I just want to make sure
277,1140.61,1147.87,7,3,Okay Yeah
278,1144.46,1147.61,7,2,Is there a better I mean now we are almost sure
279,1148,1155.31,7,1,We can start with the smaller one we can put on the smaller because it is because it is
280,1152.23,1157.11,7,3,Okay yeah okay I don'­t 
281,1155.61,1159.24,7,2,We have this can we utilize this paper somehow
282,1160.67,1163.89,7,2,I don'­t think so Like putting weights
283,1162.23,1162.53,7,3,No
284,1167.34,1170.23,7,3,Or like but where it'­s somehow
285,1174.79,1176.27,7,3,Oh I uh like
286,1177.63,1178.59,7,1,I think we should
287,1178.85,1181.37,7,1,You should take it like this
288,1179.89,1181.61,7,3,Yeah hold it like this yeah
289,1183.59,1184.16,7,3,And like
290,1198.72,1200.71,7,1,Yeah it's it's uh Yeah I think we need more
291,1197,1200.93,7,3,Okay what does it more
292,1208.39,1208.79,7,3,Still more
293,1209.67,1209.91,7,1,Yeah
294,1213.97,1214.23,7,3,How about now
295,1216.73,1219.23,7,2,Am I holding it right in the center I hope
296,1219.43,1220.71,7,3,I think so
297,1223.56,1227,7,1,I don'­t know why but because maybe it's very
298,1232.92,1235.53,7,1,Because we need to put them on each other
299,1235.71,1237.25,7,3,Yeah but yeah
300,1239.72,1248.21,7,3,Could you like make it more like no no uh more yeah go right there like yeah like that
301,1241.75,1244.45,7,2,Like this like this
302,1249.32,1252.34,7,3,So where is oh yellow is
303,1258.13,1259,7,3,And
304,1261.61,1263.72,7,3,I think it's slanted this way
305,1264.51,1264.73,7,1,Yeah
306,1266.82,1268.98,7,2,Is it is it because I'm holding it incorrect
307,1269.01,1271.74,7,3,I think so Can I try holding it yeah
308,1274.5,1276.66,7,2,If we had like a string that could
309,1277,1279,7,3,How about try doing it now
310,1279.12,1281.09,7,2,Okay so we definitely know that this is
311,1281.59,1283.87,7,3,Uh this is the mystery block yes
312,1285.81,1289.11,7,1,So if you oh I see 
313,1289.18,1299.25,7,3,Yeah so Uh yeah how about you add it first and then I'll pick it up and see how heavy
314,1290.48,1291.74,7,1,It sounds like
315,1293.27,1300.84,7,2,You should be holding this We definitely know that it's
316,1301.59,1303.87,7,1,Which one is the biggest one
317,1304,1305.28,7,3,So the biggest one is yellow
318,1309.99,1317.76,7,2,It's not exactly clear It's not a good method I think It's not a good method
319,1314.99,1315.43,7,3,Yeah
320,1318,1319.74,7,3,Hmm okay
321,1319.58,1325.28,7,1,What about that one but we start from a smaller one we should try that
322,1326,1330.56,7,1,Yeah you um just keep them but from the small one
323,1329.28,1333.31,7,3,Yeah we start from the smallest no uh in your hands
324,1335.26,1338.84,7,3,Yeah like you hold it the same way but we start with like the smallest
325,1343.02,1346,7,3,How does it feel right now Okay
326,1344.97,1345.52,7,2,Feels heavier
327,1353.59,1354.31,7,2,Still heavier
328,1354.85,1355.09,7,3,Okay
329,1358.34,1360.59,7,3,I think that would be heavier now
330,1362.34,1365.94,7,2,I think it's the same Around the same
331,1365.93,1370.95,7,3,Okay how about uh no no uh could you put the blue one back yeah
332,1371.5,1374.67,7,3,Uh and we'll like remove one of them
333,1378.36,1381.36,7,2,Yeah this is heavier now The right side
334,1379.86,1380.61,7,3,This is heavier now
335,1381.62,1382.93,7,3,Okay uh
336,1383.63,1386.13,7,1,What was the weight of that
337,1385.92,1387.17,7,3,I think this was twenty
338,1389.97,1392.73,7,3,Let's uh change this
339,1400.25,1400.5,7,2,Heavier
340,1401,1402.34,7,3,This is okay
341,1403.41,1404.14,7,3,And
342,1406.12,1406.27,7,3,Sorry
343,1423.47,1424.59,7,2,This is heavier right side I think
344,1425.25,1425.98,7,3,Okay
345,1427.54,1429.63,7,2,Now you try because I'm getting used to it
346,1429.83,1431.84,7,3,Oh uh
347,1431.34,1432.09,7,1,Because when
348,1432.61,1434.41,7,3,I don'­t okay sure
349,1435.59,1436.1,7,3,So
350,1440.41,1442.09,7,3,I will keep my eyes closed
351,1444.42,1445.92,7,3,This is heavier the right side
352,1450.86,1457.59,7,2,You can always uh like your right hand side you can always put it down and pick it up again because you might get used to it
353,1458.12,1458.59,7,3,Okay
354,1460.61,1462.09,7,3,Seems similar
355,1462.68,1466.13,7,2,Sort of can you put down the right side and pick it up again
356,1469.83,1472.11,7,3,Yeah no this is heavy Yeah
357,1471.26,1472,7,2,Right side is heavy
358,1473,1479.79,7,2,Okay stop stop Because I felt that was heavier you felt that this was heavier So we neeed to
359,1477.57,1484.11,7,3,Yeah No uh when you felt it was heavier it was like this three blocks
360,1485.09,1490.38,7,2,These four you mean Was it So it means
361,1486.36,1494.38,7,3,Uh yeah these four blocks not the green one Yeah So it's between like these two
362,1494.82,1507.39,7,3,How about you try uh like try it with this one since we know like that this is the heaviest that we know of we put some random ones uh
363,1515.42,1516.13,7,2,This feels heavier
364,1518.79,1521.31,7,1,Really but it wasn't
365,1521.53,1528.34,7,3,Yeah Okay so Okay
366,1526.79,1527.28,7,2,It feel the same
367,1532.59,1535.07,7,3,This one which one feels similar
368,1538.66,1542.09,7,1,I think we should callibrate for example these
369,1548.27,1555.57,7,1,No we should callibrate like this and we put other thing and we remove one thing
370,1556,1572.98,7,3,Yeah I think that is a good idea like we use same weights initially and then add like different Yeah yeah but you need to like keep your eyes closed for that
371,1563.66,1570.52,7,1,And we add and we don'­t say to you that what we add or we and finally we find
372,1572.67,1576.75,7,2,These are equal this is thirty and this
373,1574.56,1577.75,7,1,And we just um mix this together
374,1577.27,1581.5,7,3,That is fifty this is twenty yes and this is thirty
375,1579.34,1579.84,7,2,Oh this is fifty
376,1582.84,1584.09,7,2,Fifty twenty thirty
377,1584.58,1584.85,7,3,Yes
378,1585.92,1588.17,7,2,Also let's do a combine together
379,1587.92,1596,7,1,No no just start with these and we add different things until you said they are equal Okay take these two
380,1598.79,1598.84,7,1,Just  
381,1606.09,1606.59,7,2,Feels the same to me
382,1608.09,1608.63,7,3,Okay
383,1609.83,1614.19,7,1,So you should feel those at first that they are
384,1620.49,1621.46,7,2,This is heavier
385,1622.57,1625.59,7,3,Okay uh how about now
386,1631.33,1631.83,7,2,This is heavier
387,1632.59,1633.09,7,3,And now
388,1643.16,1643.61,7,2,This is heavier
389,1644.98,1645.71,7,3,And now
390,1652.79,1653.59,7,2,Same
391,1654,1659.84,7,3,Okay I okay could you like put them down yeah
392,1660.09,1664.33,7,1,It doesn'­t feel correct
393,1663.59,1666.66,7,3,I don'­t okay so like
394,1667.92,1681,7,2,So that but this is equal This is fifty ten sixty sixty plus six so this is ninety
395,1670.56,1678.39,7,3,So if like these feel similar so Fifty Thirty
396,1681.59,1687.59,7,2,And this is Thirty ninety minus thirty sixty
397,1683,1687.92,7,3,Ten twenty thirty is sixty
398,1688.46,1689.42,7,2,Should we lock sixty
399,1690.96,1691.73,7,1,Which one was fifty
400,1692.19,1693.46,7,3,Uh this one was fifty
401,1694.49,1695.18,7,2,You're sure about that right
402,1695.95,1696.21,7,3,Yeah
403,1698.58,1702,7,2,Let's since we already have something let's close your eyes
404,1706,1707,7,1,I should feel like this
405,1721.29,1724.37,7,3,Which one is heavier Yeah
406,1723.75,1724,7,1,This one
407,1727.28,1729,7,2,This was in the same group right
408,1732.09,1732.62,7,3,How about now
409,1733.33,1736.11,7,1,It's heavier It's this one
410,1734.64,1736.73,7,2,Which one Left one
411,1737.48,1737.67,7,1,This one
412,1737.87,1744.33,7,3,Your left hand yeah ok this is heavier ok uh
413,1739.18,1743.67,7,1,Yes Yeah I feel heavier
414,1740.69,1741.19,7,2,It's heavier
415,1747.82,1748.23,7,3,How about now
416,1754,1757.02,7,1,I feel heavier Left one
417,1755.89,1756.35,7,2,Which one
418,1758.1,1760.37,7,3,Okay how about now
419,1766.25,1766.64,7,1,The same
420,1767.41,1773,7,3,Okay okay uh you can put them down So we have like this is twenty
421,1770.87,1771.75,7,2,This is how much
422,1774.5,1777.89,7,3,So we have like two answers and we have like two tries
423,1778.64,1786.41,7,3,So uh this is the Nah I think I'm good Yeah we've got like uh
424,1780.94,1792.67,7,2,Do you do you want to try it again So this is uh either sixty or or eighty right
425,1789.47,1794.58,7,3,So twenty plus thirty fifty uh
426,1797,1801.86,7,3,So like the first option is sixty which or eighty
427,1799.89,1801,7,2,Or eighty right because
428,1802.59,1805,7,2,Because this was heavier that means it has to be eighty
429,1802.63,1808.42,7,3,I think so yeah fifty thirty isn't this a hundred
430,1809.92,1811.09,7,3,Like twenty thirty and fifty
431,1812.41,1815.21,7,3,So either a hundred or sixty no
432,1815.97,1817.72,7,1,I think we need to add sixty
433,1817.17,1819.46,7,2,Sixty or eighty I don'­t know
434,1819.97,1822.68,7,3,This was one block that Shadi tried right
435,1824,1824.79,7,2,Do you feel it's the same
436,1824.5,1825.68,7,1,It's eighty
437,1828.6,1835,7,3,So fifty plus thirty plus twenty is a hundred yeah and the other block was
438,1835.1,1838.47,7,2,So either a hundred or sixty but that's too steep a jump
439,1840.96,1843.68,7,1,I think we should go with ninety and eighty 
440,1841.43,1851.75,7,3,We could try first eighty eighty first Okay Yeah Should eighty final okay
441,1854.33,1855.59,7,3,Um oh eighty
442,1862.43,1864.18,7,3,Yup and then let's
443,1865.33,1875.5,7,3,Okay uh ten ten twenty thirty eighty and fifty yup
444,1877.5,1883.25,7,4,For the final part of this task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the second mystery block
445,1883.75,1888,7,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
446,1889.97,1891.92,7,2,Which is the missing second block
447,1910.87,1912.67,7,1,It should be something like
448,1913.67,1915.09,7,2,The second mystery block
449,1915.67,1923.42,7,3,Does this not seem like the Fibonacci sequence like one one two three five eight and then one thirty
450,1924.25,1924.5,7,1,Yeah
451,1928.33,1928.58,7,3,Yeah
452,1930.09,1937.84,7,2,One one two three five yeah yeah
453,1936.33,1940.67,7,3,Five plus three eight Which is
454,1938.17,1940.92,7,2,So that should be eight plus five so thirteen
455,1943.42,1944.17,7,1,Are we sure
456,1944.92,1950.18,7,3,I like Yeah like it seems the obvious pattern
457,1955.25,1955.5,7,3,Okay
458,1958.09,1959.09,7,1,We can't have
459,1960.84,1970.84,7,1,Actually we can't have forty because we have this one we can't have sixty we have this seventy we have these two eighty
460,1971.78,1974.09,7,1,But we can't oh yeah it's it's Fibonacci
461,1978,1978.75,7,3,Yeah like if
462,1980.09,1983.85,7,3,I think so Okay um
463,1980.59,1981.85,7,2,Yeah one thirty
464,1990.59,1992.09,7,3,If anybody else wants to type
465,2015.32,2015.58,7,3,Yeah
466,2019.89,2023.84,7,1,Maybe we should guess the weight of that with Fibonacci as well
467,2025,2026.5,7,2,Yeah that was one thirty so it'll be
468,2026.47,2029.47,7,1,No I mean this one based on the other
469,2027.5,2033.5,7,3,This one yeah so one one two three five and then three plus five is eight
470,2033.52,2033.85,7,1,Yeah
471,2034.31,2034.47,7,3,Yeah 
472,2050.5,2051.25,7,3,I think so
473,2052.08,2057.25,7,2,We placed the in the correct position so it was easy to see that they fit into the Fibonacci series
474,2057.42,2060.24,7,3,Yeah I think that is fine
475,2063.17,2063.21,7,3,Yeah
476,2064.17,2064.67,7,1,Hey
477,2070.42,2071,7,1,Are we done
