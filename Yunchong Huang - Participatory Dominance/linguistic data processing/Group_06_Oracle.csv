0,3.09,6.9,6,4,I need to callibrate my cameras and then we can get started
1,11.19,14.61,6,4,The task that you will be completing today is called the weights task
2,15.03,20.61,6,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of these colorful cubes here
3,21.12,24.51,6,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
4,25.44,30.93,6,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten so you don't need to use the slider at all
5,31.35,38.25,6,4,Um the scale like is a little bit finnicky but like as long as it doesn't drop down it's probably good like you can see right now it's
6,39.75,47.55,6,4,Um so as you work through the tasks if you can place the cubes on the sheet where they go and also fill out the survey
7,47.82,50.79,6,4,Um that is on this computer
8,51,57.09,6,4,With the answers and you guys are going to be group number six and you can now start the survey
9,61.23,64.67,6,1,I guess if this red one's ten grams
10,63.42,66,6,2,We got red ten
11,72.45,76.17,6,1,Seems like it might be about the same
12,80.52,85.29,6,3,I would agree yeah so this one's ten
13,85.47,86.92,6,3,Alright let's see if we can find a twenty
14,89.76,91.06,6,3,Too heavy so
15,91.17,93.15,6,2,Way too heavy
16,97.44,99.78,6,2,This is a sensitive scale
17,102.35,104.28,6,2,Looks like about twenty
18,102.3,103.5,6,1,That's looking pretty even
19,104.76,109.2,6,3,Alright let's see if we can find a thirty
20,110.82,113.19,6,1,So this one is noticeably heavier than
21,109.44,110.75,6,2,Probably that big sucker
22,113.94,115.95,6,1,The purple ish one
23,119.42,121.75,6,1,Making sure that it didn't have the weight at the bottom
24,116.79,125.37,6,2,It's just stuff written at the bottom that's a so that's a ten and a twenty right now right that's looking
25,125.49,127.47,6,2,Well
26,127.62,130.21,6,2,They're increments of ten I would say that's probably
27,130.42,131.76,6,1,Yeah I think
28,130.66,135.96,6,2,Cause that's also a twenty let's double check that that's not also a twenty
29,131.79,132.58,6,1,Yeah it looks a little
30,136.44,141.09,6,2,Cause it um just that one there
31,137.36,138.33,6,3,Is this one a twenty
32,141.18,146.85,6,2,Ok so it's more than twenty but it almost seems like the thirty takes it past but
33,148.2,150.18,6,2,It's so sensitive
34,157.58,159.58,6,2,If they're only in increments of ten it has to be
35,156.33,161.08,6,1,I think yeah it has to be thirty it 
36,160.58,162.57,6,3,I think it could also be the position
37,164.46,166.67,6,2,So big blue is probably thirty
38,162.84,163.67,6,3,Of the weight
39,168.42,171.21,6,1,So I would guess the yellow one is gonna be
40,172.35,174.33,6,1,Forty
41,177.57,178.08,6,2,Fifty
42,178.12,179.55,6,3,Fifty
43,180.33,182.31,6,1,Oh maybe not
44,186.24,190.92,6,3,Yeah that's considerably heavier so this one did we say this was thirty
45,191.01,192.58,6,3,And this was ten
46,192.61,195.21,6,2,Yeah that's thirty green is twenty
47,195.24,196.42,6,2,Red and small blue are both ten
48,196.52,199.41,6,3,It's definitely not thirty so it has to
49,201.21,202.25,6,3,But it's too heavy
50,202.58,203.97,6,1,So that's
51,205.44,209.58,6,1,This is fifty on here so then
52,208.08,209.08,6,3,Yeah fifty
53,208.84,211.5,6,2,Yeah green and big blue
54,211.56,222.66,6,3,Did we try forty we did try forty because this one's thirty and then this one's or this one's twenty so this
55,211.56,211.92,6,1,Big blue
56,215.67,219.67,6,2,Unless she's messing with us and some of these are in increments of five
57,224.5,226.56,6,2,So that should be forty right there
58,223.5,226.56,6,1,Big blue was forty
59,239.41,243.39,6,2,I would say yellow is like forty five but we could say fifty since we're
60,237.36,240.75,6,1,I would say that it is at least closest to fifty
61,243.57,246.33,6,2,Forced with these
62,246.39,248.73,6,1,Alright
63,253.86,255.84,6,2,Sweet
64,258.08,261.46,6,4,Have you filled it out on the computer you guys are group six
65,256.35,257.34,6,3,I think we're done
66,261.83,264.54,6,2,Ok nice
67,268.74,271.38,6,1,Yellow is fifty
68,273.39,278.25,6,2,Green's twenty big blue's thirty
69,278.11,279.48,6,3,Yeah I guess that one's
70,280.11,286.44,6,3,I think that one's purple so blue was ten and then purple was thirty
71,282.21,282.5,6,2,Oh that's purple you're right
72,286.5,288.48,6,2,Yes
73,291.99,299.55,6,3,So red was ten yellow was fifty we're great
74,294.75,295.92,6,2,We got it right good job team
75,304.38,308.52,6,4,You need to now determine the weight of this mystery block
76,308.82,314.61,6,4,Without using the scale you will have two attempts to enter it correctly onto this survey and you can now begin
77,314.94,315.58,6,3,Alright guys
78,315.66,318.27,6,2,Fun oh boy
79,318.33,320.7,6,3,Is it heavy
80,321.27,324.69,6,2,We should each do it separate and see what we think
81,324.75,325.91,6,3,Just don't say it until you
82,325.75,327.51,6,2,Yeah exactly
83,331.65,336.15,6,3,Oh I guess we can see it
84,339.33,340.16,6,2,Ok  
85,368.76,374.55,6,2,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be
86,380.83,383.46,6,2,Are we allowed to make our own scales is there rules
87,377.79,381.02,6,1,I don't think she intends for us
88,385.26,388.8,6,2,Or are you not allowed to tell us what we are allowed to do
89,389.01,390.99,6,4,You guys are just problem solving
90,395.16,399.72,6,2,That's about as even as I can get it unless somebody can
91,394.59,395.67,6,3,I like your idea
92,399.75,402.75,6,2,We're getting close
93,406.41,412.14,6,2,But let's let him do hands and then we'll we'll play with that but I'm thinking
94,412.65,414.66,6,2,More right yeah
95,416.22,419.4,6,2,Yeah maybe one of these
96,417.17,418.42,6,3,I'm interested in this
97,422.19,424.8,6,3,Oh that's a heavy one
98,424.95,427.35,6,2,Yeah
99,427.47,429.9,6,3,Ok
100,432.21,437.07,6,2,Yeah so if you held if you hold them all in one and like yeah
101,434.56,435.84,6,3,Which ones twenty this one
102,437.4,439.38,6,2,Um yeah
103,443.31,447.78,6,2,So now you've got forty on there now you've got
104,452.79,463.65,6,1,Let's see how callibrated this is or
105,457.84,463.65,6,2,Yeah oh yeah yeah put your ten and your ten let's callibrate our little scale
106,465.93,467.67,6,2,So even when they're equal it leans
107,766.92,470.85,6,1,It leans slowly that way
108,472.38,474.9,6,1,Let's try the thirty and then
109,474.99,481.42,6,1,Purple and then let's put green and a ten
110,479.83,483.6,6,3,Alright alright lemme just lemme just give it a go here
111,483.72,488.91,6,3,Alright so how much do we have here one twenty total
112,486.47,487.67,6,2,One twenty total
113,491.66,495.67,6,2,That felt to me like it was heavier than all of those
114,488.94,498.63,6,3,So it's gotta be like a like heavier so it's over one twenty we know that so it's over one twenty
115,498.84,504.3,6,3,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say
116,500.01,500.92,6,2,I would agree with that
117,504.51,508.32,6,3,We've only got two choices above oh we have three choices above
118,509.22,514.25,6,1,Well and it could be past the end of sheet if they're trying to be tricky
119,513.92,517.68,6,2,Yeah she gives us up to one fifty on our survey
120,519.25,529.86,6,2,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up
121,520.75,523.5,6,1,Let me see um yes I can 
122,518.46,519.42,6,3,Alright let me see  
123,530.22,532.84,6,1,Drink enough coffee until it weighs the weight is
124,531.34,532.48,6,2,What's the what's the
125,532.95,534.84,6,3,How much is the yellow one again
126,534.93,535.84,6,2,That one was fifty
127,536.31,537.18,6,3,Fifty
128,537.45,539.94,6,3,Alright so I would say I would say
129,540.57,545.07,6,3,We have one twenty we got at least forty so I would say one sixty
130,545.19,548.16,6,3,So one fifty is the highest yeah
131,546.15,546.56,6,2,Yeah
132,548.22,550.91,6,2,I'm I'm good with it it's real heavy
133,558.75,553.77,6,3,Here if anybody wants to yeah it's heavy
134,556.95,560.34,6,3,These are the only I would go higher than one fifty
135,559.08,560.34,6,2,Yeah
136,560.49,564.03,6,1,See if some of these blocks weigh similar to my coffee
137,560.92,562.84,6,2,That's definitely our only options
138,566.55,568.77,6,3,Do you know how much the coffee weighs though
139,570.05,572.25,6,2,If he just said it off the bat I would be like wow
140,569.13,577.86,6,1,I wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three
141,575.5,576.02,6,3,Alright 
142,578.37,589.08,6,1,So we can use that as an estimate or we can but we know how much these three weigh and if its about the same as the coffee
143,581.25,587.08,6,3,Yeah we don't know how much the coffee weighs though true
144,589.95,593.42,6,2,Oh then we can start adding more is what he's saying ok got it
145,589.83,594.36,6,3,Then yeah the coffe oh ok 
146,594.66,601.74,6,2,So and these three would be yellow purple and blue which would be a hundred right no ninety
147,602.49,605.4,6,1,Yeah if you wanna see and feel it and make sure it's
148,602.49,603.08,6,2,So
149,606.21,608.19,6,1,Roughly the same
150,611.88,615.87,6,2,Sure this might even be a tad tad heavier but
151,620.4,623.22,6,2,Sorry
152,624.84,628.75,6,2,I mean that does seem like we're getting closer interesting
153,627.25,630.72,6,3,So what do you have there two hundred
154,631.65,639.24,6,2,Yeah ninety plus ninety so one eighty yeah I think the heaviest option and if it's wrong go one forty
155,634.08,636.92,6,3,One eighty yeah
156,639.75,642.99,6,2,And we get two tries
157,644.25,646.23,6,2,Here's a hint
158,648.42,650.76,6,3,Ah think of a pattern
159,648.66,649.25,6,1,Oh
160,652.14,654.12,6,1,Ten ten
161,655.41,657.39,6,1,Twenty
162,658.35,663.57,6,1,Thirty oh it's the sum of the previous two weights
163,664.14,668.58,6,1,Ten and ten make twenty ten and twenty make thirty twenty thirty fifty
164,669.24,671.22,6,2,Fifty thirty eighty
165,672,679.25,6,2,There's no way that's eighty it feels way heavier but the pattern sticks
166,675.75,679.5,6,3,Hey I'm that's some sound logic right there yeah
167,680.94,682.02,6,3,I like that idea
168,687.67,693.21,6,3,Cause it's definitely not one fifty anyways so we might as well just
169,684.75,687.25,6,2,Yeah I guess now that my I mean
170,696.24,701.5,6,3,What do you guys think that makes sense yeah
171,697.35,702.6,6,1,I I feel like it it I think it feels heaiver but
172,705.18,712.56,6,2,Why can't I think of what this pattern is right now the name for this pattern fib yeah so are we we're doing fib
173,707.68,710.84,6,3,What do you no so like here here's the first one yeah
174,708.08,710.33,6,1,It's the fibonacci sequence
175,712.77,715.23,6,2,So then that would be there
176,717.08,720.01,6,3,Are you guys good with eighty
177,715.95,725.01,6,2,It's a good I mean it's the best we got I'm I'm ok with it I stand I stand to lose nothing here
178,720.66,723.5,6,1,Yeah I'll be willing to trust the hint
179,726.15,728.01,6,2,We got it so given the hint
180,725.16,729.87,6,3,Eighty grams we're geniuses
181,732.43,734.04,6,3,It's way heavier than eighty
182,730.62,732.75,6,2,Gosh this thing felt like way heavier to me
183,739.17,746.34,6,4,For the final part of the task read the scenario survey and estimate the weight of the 
184,734.13,735.08,6,1,We're done with this part 
185,734.63,740.83,6,3,Yeah I think that's an idication of the alright can we get the scale back real quIck
186,734.16,737.33,6,2,Yeah I want to see these on a scale full of
187,746.4,752.16,6,4,Of the missing second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
188,752.25,758.4,6,2,Yeah I mean we feel like we're there already so fifty plus eighty is one thirty
189,758.91,761.46,6,2,So I'd say a missing would be one thirty
190,761.67,764.28,6,2,And I would say the explanation is fib
191,768.42,771.67,6,3,Alright so one thirty then
192,769.5,772.53,6,2,Yep yep
193,776.16,779.17,6,3,One or two sentences who wants to be a literary
194,780.48,781.33,6,1,I've got it
195,781.41,784.08,6,2,Cool
196,784.68,786.66,6,2,Given the clue
197,789.83,792.27,6,2,Yeah I wouldn't have picked that up that's fun
198,812.43,815.4,6,2,eighty plus fifty plus
199,824.84,826.11,6,2,Did it
200,823.77,824.75,6,1,We're done
