Utterance,Start,End,Group,Participant,Transcript
0,5.97,8.04,8,2,Or is it
1,8.07,11.55,8,2,Yeah green is for twenty
2,13.08,15.21,8,3,Ok so now
3,15.45,18.21,8,3,I'll just take these off and then we can have a little more
4,18.93,22.31,8,3,fine grained control oh
5,21.66,22.5,8,1,Sorry
6,22.65,24.63,8,3,It's ok
7,25.74,29.02,8,1,Can I add the red one or blue one here maybe it might be thirty
8,25.74,29.31,8,3,Cause yeah
9,32.52,35.67,8,2,So twenty that's thirty
10,36.9,38.88,8,3,Yeah  
11,42.6,47.75,8,3,I mean the fact that it's teetering back and forth it's close enough they're just increments of ten grams
12,45.45,48.72,8,1,Yeah so the blue one is thirty
13,48.78,51.75,8,2,Blue is thirty big blue is thirty
14,45.75,50.01,8,3,Yeah
15,51.87,54.33,8,3,So it's thirty here
16,56.55,64.66,8,2,Did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might
17,58.58,64.86,8,1,Did we measure we didn't measure the yellow just keep one
18,61.33,62.83,8,3,Oh I thought ok 
19,65.67,67.95,8,1,And keep the thirty
20,60.3,73.95,8,2,Let's try both the green ones now I mean both the big ones yeah
21,67.98,69.43,8,3,Let's try
22,74.12,74.75,8,2,Too heavy
23,74.07,76.05,8,1,Oh that's too left
24,76.41,78.45,8,1,Try the red
25,78.51,80.61,8,1,Keep that one
26,84.75,88.17,8,2,What if we do the green one and the two smaller cubes
27,88.53,91.26,8,2,Cause that's going to be pushing that way
28,91.53,92.76,8,3,Gotcha are they centered
29,93.62,95.79,8,1,This is twenty or thirty
30,96.31,99.69,8,3,Let's just make sure I guess they are centered
31,96.06,96.75,8,2,Yeah I feel that way
32,98.25,99.25,8,3,These are ten
33,100.05,106.25,8,2,Green green is twenty so green is twenty and then we said this one is thirty right
34,100.45,106.77,8,3,Green is twenty ok green is twenty thirty yeah
35,107.01,108.99,8,1,But let's see let's
36,114.15,117,8,1,Needs more weight
37,117.36,119.58,8,1,Let's try forty
38,119.76,126.39,8,2,That's too light and we know that green is equal to
39,126.42,128.4,8,2,This one and that one
40,128.94,131.25,8,2,So let's try this one too
41,132,134.91,8,1,Oh it's more than forty
42,136.23,141.09,8,3,So let's see the weights we know
43,144.78,146.76,8,1,Between forty and fifty
44,155.4,157.66,8,2,It's definitely not staying in between right
45,157.58,159.33,8,1,Yeah it's more than forty
46,159.64,162.21,8,3,But which one was thirty I'm just
47,162.3,164.88,8,1,This is thirty this is twenty
48,162.82,163.58,8,3,Thirty ok
49,163.08,164.88,8,2,Yeah twenty  
50,165.72,166.33,8,2,So what if we do
51,166.66,168.09,8,1,This is more than forty
52,168.21,170.67,8,1,But we don't and less than fifty actually
53,171.39,173.97,8,3,Yeah
54,174.33,175.16,8,1,Twenty plus ten thirty
55,175.91,177.18,8,2,Thirty  
56,178.17,180.15,8,1,Forty
57,187.98,190.38,8,1,Forty
58,191.28,191.92,8,1,Fifty
59,192.41,194.13,8,2,Fifty so heavy or
60,194.46,196.62,8,1,Fifty is too heavy
61,198.15,203.75,8,3,I mean it could be just like how they were placed on like measured at like I don't know
62,197.1,198.92,8,1,Yeah it is between forty and fifty
63,202.25,204.87,8,2,Like can we use a combination of
64,206.83,210.08,8,3,We can't we can't get between so
65,206.07,212.19,8,1,We tried all of the combinations yeah yeah we can try this
66,209.82,211.22,8,2,So we can move one of these
67,213.6,215.58,8,3,Yeah but
68,215.97,220.35,8,3,We know it's between forty and fifty we can't really
69,217.93,219.24,8,1,We can add weight
70,220.5,224.4,8,3,Cause everything else we know is like a multiple of ten so we just can't
71,223.66,224.33,8,2,Yeah
72,225.06,227.49,8,3,Directly compare it um
73,227.73,231.03,8,1,Actually just adding one gram made it equal
74,232.47,234.45,8,1,I just added one gram
75,234.93,237.9,8,2,Oh yeah cause it's a scale yeah so
76,237.08,237.9,8,3,Yeah
77,237.93,239.33,8,1,So it's forty one
78,241.63,243.21,8,2,Yeah forty one
79,246.3,248.52,8,2,So should we
80,248.55,251.25,8,2,Where should we put it then in forty
81,249.58,252.9,8,1,I think actually everything is not round figured
82,253.23,258.84,8,1,Presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure it accurately
83,259.22,261.87,8,3,Wait so is this just in the wrong place or is this the twenty
84,259.11,260.01,8,1,Precisely
85,264.17,271.62,8,3,Is this in the wrong place or is this ok so this is thirty fifty minus one so 
86,263.01,272.73,8,1,Shall we try that no it's twenty yeah one no not minus one minus nine
87,272.91,277.75,8,1,Ok minus one it is yeah so it is forty nine
88,274.25,278.28,8,1,Yeah forty nine yeah
89,275.25,276.5,8,2,Minus one forty nine
90,280.2,284.04,8,3,Ok so it's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently
91,284.34,286.32,8,3,And callibrate it
92,287.28,289.59,8,3,Would you agree with that
93,295.35,296.25,8,3,I think we're done
94,297.5,298.41,8,1,Yeah
95,298.65,302.94,8,4,Have you filled out the survey on the computer as well and you guys will be 
96,299.91,300.3,8,1,No  
97,310.2,312.5,8,3,Should we double check anything or just assume that we got it 
98,312.66,315.48,8,1,Should we be precise to one gram
99,318.01,319.92,8,4,Just do rounding to tenths
100,316.92,323.37,8,1,Should we tenths length ok that's fine yeah
101,320.17,322.75,8,2,Ok so fifty is fine
102,323.49,326.25,8,3,Yeah we just got stumped cause it was like
103,326.28,328.44,8,3,Close
104,329.73,333.66,8,3,Yeah so we're definitely right
105,331.55,332.24,8,2,Yeah
106,336.18,339.84,8,3,So you want to just like tell me the numbers cause
107,340.06,348,8,2,So yellow is fifty they said yellow's cause it was forty so yellow's fifty green is twenty
108,342.92,343.17,8,1,Yeah
109,349.74,352.02,8,2,Um purple is thirty
110,353.88,358.05,8,2,Yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten
111,359.16,365.25,8,2,Yeah I was like yeah I was like kind of confused wait what the lighting but
112,365.91,368.13,8,2,So red is ten blue is
113,366.56,366.84,8,3,Fifty
114,369.09,371.07,8,2,Was thirty yep
115,371.1,373.5,8,2,Um green is twenty yep and then yellow
116,379.32,380.08,8,2,Ok which way
117,380.58,381.81,8,1,White block
118,382.26,384.24,8,3,Mystery block
119,385.08,396.57,8,4,Ok now you need to determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale
120,384.3,391.84,8,1,Is there any mystery block third weight
121,394.23,395.01,8,2,Nice
122,396.75,399.24,8,4,You will have two attempts to enter the weight correctly
123,399.92,405.01,8,3,Ok so it might have to do with the numbers and stuff but
124,399.27,399.75,8,4,And you can now begin
125,402.01,405.57,8,1,It's like um
126,405.84,406.82,8,3,Either that or we could just
127,406.75,410.1,8,1,I think it's for data reference I don't know
128,410.79,413.64,8,3,Pretty heavy so let's read the numbers to see if we can
129,413.82,415.8,8,3,Notice a pattern
130,417.48,421.38,8,2,Interesting I was definitely right yeah it's definitely
131,421.77,424.95,8,2,Hundred and fifty grams but um
132,425.1,428.34,8,2,I mean we could use a combination of these
133,432.59,438.81,8,1,Actually since the like the density is different we can't actually compare directly
134,429.96,431.08,8,2,To see you know how to 
135,439.71,442.56,8,3,Yeah but let's make sure we don't lose our order
136,442.74,450.81,8,3,Um and if you notice they all have this kind of stuff written on them so maybe this is
137,442.92,449.42,8,1,Um yeah green is twenty yep let's check that
138,452.33,453.99,8,2,Well they all say the same thing
139,451.47,451.98,8,1,Thirty or 
140,454.56,456.63,8,2,They all say
141,458.4,460.38,8,1,They all say the same thing actually
142,460.62,464.37,8,2,So I don't think it matters um
143,462.33,464.07,8,3,Gotcha  
144,466.05,475.38,8,3,We can feel a hole right here so maybe we can see how much is drilled out as well
145,475.53,477.08,8,3,I don't want to do math right now
146,475.71,479.76,8,1,This has a forty now give me the thirty one
147,481.65,484.77,8,1,It is twenty one second
148,485.07,487.05,8,1,Yeah this is thirty
149,489.6,491.58,8,1,It has a hole
150,495.63,498.54,8,2,Or let's all like do what he's doing
151,498.6,506.25,8,2,And like like so like we all get a feel and then we could all come up with like a result
152,500.02,506.25,8,3,Yeah I guess yeah
153,502.84,504.34,8,1,Can you add a ten for me 
154,507.36,515.46,8,3,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference
155,516.57,519.93,8,1,Um uh remove the ten
156,525.21,527.64,8,2,Want me to add the green
157,525.21,527.64,8,1,It's that yeah
158,527.76,529.74,8,1,Try that
159,532.65,536.04,8,1,And that just a little bit try that
160,547.89,550.17,8,2,Lowkey add a ten
161,561.63,564.15,8,2,Another ten
162,569.55,571.53,8,2,Too heavy
163,576.925,580.92,8,1,Because after a volume more volume we can't actually
164,587.34,589.8,8,2,That feels more like it I'm going to be honest
165,589.92,592.56,8,3,Ok and then can we like
166,592.59,594.57,8,3,Makeshift our own sort of like
167,594.9,601.05,8,3,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel
168,602.76,604.74,8,4,You guys are free to solve the task as 
169,606,608.31,8,3,Ok
170,608.58,611.28,8,3,Uh it's this one we want now
171,612.31,621.67,8,3,We are like halfway over the edge and we can just barely balance it actually we need something bigger
172,612.24,624.09,8,1,We also try that that is fair if it is the rectangle we can try that
173,624.31,625.08,8,2,The purple is
174,625.62,628.35,8,3,So like what's going to get just like barely
175,635.61,637.89,8,1,It started falling
176,643.71,647.58,8,3,I think that it needs more
177,648.45,650.43,8,2,Are they the same size though
178,651.54,653.88,8,3,Uh the bottom one shouldn't matter
179,653.91,657.09,8,3,In then as long as we have the same on either side of that line
180,657.42,658.75,8,3,Stacking up
181,659.08,660.81,8,1,Keep it in that sect diagnal
182,664.8,666.78,8,3,How close is this though
183,679.42,676.17,8,3,That might have been it that was three 
184,667.65,669.67,8,2,I think that was on the line too
185,678.55,681.48,8,2,So we said like green was ten green was twenty
186,676.92,679.08,8,1,Fifty plus
187,675.01,680.08,8,3,Let's see
188,682.08,685.11,8,3,I think that might be it should we do it again just to be sure
189,681.84,682.11,8,1,Fifty plus
190,682.58,683.58,8,2,Yellow was fifty
191,686.58,687.87,8,3,Ok
192,685.33,686.33,8,2,Yeah
193,688.56,691.26,8,1,Keep it in that sect diagnal
194,693.57,697.62,8,3,Wait a sec ok so this actually matters how we
195,708.39,711.24,8,3,Well that's pretty unstable right there I think
196,712.02,714,8,2,Yeah right there all right
197,714.84,716.82,8,2,Good enough at approximation
198,722.61,727.35,8,3,Set it like all the way into the center line it's just enough room to support it
199,727.62,730.98,8,3,And I'll just kind of support this with my finger and then I'll move my finger
200,731.34,733.53,8,3,Like if I don't feel weight we can just see how
201,744.72,747.12,8,3,And so that's not close but it'll be
202,747.18,749.16,8,3,That
203,752.61,758.07,8,3,I think if we add another one here but we want to make sure it looks like it's straight up and down also
204,749.85,750.76,8,2,How much weight is that if you yeah I think you
205,751.58,752.75,8,1,If we add it
206,765.33,773.49,8,2,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple
207,765.33,767.58,8,3,So I think that's it
208,773.52,776.46,8,2,Purple and a yellow green
209,776.61,780.78,8,2,And red right yellow green
210,777.31,777.83,8,1,Yes
211,780.96,783.06,8,2,It's ten
212,783.15,785.43,8,2,Green  
213,786.39,790.23,8,3,It's either that or like maybe ten more I just couldn't quite tell
214,790.89,795.21,8,3,It didn't seem like it took it much to get it to tip but also it's hard to like
215,795.42,800.49,8,3,Yield ten grams of pressure I think it's that
216,797.92,800.49,8,1,Twenty thirty fifty
217,800.76,803.37,8,1,We have two answers right we can give eighty and ninety
218,805.23,807.78,8,2,So seventy yeah we could try eighty
219,807.96,809.42,8,1,Yeah we can try eighty
220,809.23,810.3,8,2,Right in the middle
221,811.32,813.57,8,3,I don't I don't think it was in the
222,814.02,818.72,8,3,Wait what were the ones that we had on there cause I think that might have been the same
223,817.4,820.47,8,1,This this and this ten twenty and fifty
224,818.56,819.42,8,2,Yeah
225,820.74,825.66,8,3,Ok well we added an we used both of these so it's twenty twenty and fifty so fifty
226,822.06,822.75,8,1,Added a ten
227,826.15,829.5,8,3,Ninety let's see are we good with ninety
228,825.84,830.48,8,1,Try ninety nintey yeah
229,830.56,831.99,8,2,Yeah let's have another try
230,836.07,838.05,8,1,Then you can try eighty
231,841.5,842.49,8,1,We can't add more
232,839.67,841.17,8,3,I don't think we have eighty
233,842.7,846.69,8,1,Actually when we added the final ten it was able to to fall
234,844.67,845.67,8,2,It started to tip
235,846.75,851.19,8,3,It was about ready to fall but it didn't fall it needed to be touched so maybe it was a hundred
236,851.82,855.99,8,1,Ok we can try that
237,857.88,858.73,8,2,Uh it was eighty yep
238,858.83,860.08,8,3,Oh ok
239,860.06,862.35,8,1,It was eighty
240,863.48,864.81,8,2,Yeah cause
241,862.56,863.42,8,3,That's interesting
242,865.3,870.24,8,2,If you were to add another ten pounds to make it a hundred it would have definitely tilted over
243,865.2,867.33,8,3,Twenty forty
244,872.67,879.9,8,4,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery
245,880.71,889.47,8,4,You'll have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey um you will have a scenario on the
246,884.08,885.34,8,2,Ok cool so we could use this
247,885.58,887.08,8,1,Is it the second mystery block
248,891.46,892.8,8,2,Just click next
249,890.82,891.42,8,1,Just right there
250,907.89,911.28,8,1,There is no mystery block but we need to estimate the weight of it
251,914.34,917.79,8,1,Oh everytime it caught item multiplied
252,918.45,927.69,8,1,Or doubled twenty plus twenty twenty plus thirty fifty plus thirty eighty
253,928.02,930,8,1,Eighty plus fifty one thirty
254,931.44,934.25,8,1,You got my point see we have to
255,934.27,934.8,8,3,Wait
256,940.17,945,8,3,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about
257,937.8,938.67,8,1,Understand the question 
258,938.67,942.92,8,2,Create the wooden block do not send we have to
259,945.93,953.91,8,1,We don't have a mystery block the company forgot to send the block when you do estimate what the mystery block's weight was without knowing
260,947.5,950.67,8,2,It's just so we have to estimate right
261,954,955.98,8,1,Even knowing what it is
262,956.82,963.93,8,1,My estimate was like we have two tens when we add two tens we get a twenty when you get twenty plus ten we get a thirty
263,964.26,968.61,8,1,When you add thirty plus twenty we get fifty when you add fifty plus thirty we get eighty
264,968.73,971.31,8,1,When we add eighty plus fifty we get one thirty
265,973.15,980.64,8,2,Cause it's like the rate right of like how we're incrementing or I agree I would go with one thirty as well
266,972.42,973.67,8,3,Oh gotcha
267,972.42,977.75,8,1,Yeah that's what I think yeah that is how they are getting you incrementing
268,982.38,984.36,8,1,What do you think
269,984.96,988.42,8,2,Yeah makes sense cause two tens make up a twenty
270,987.73,989.08,8,3,I think you're definitely right
271,989.22,991.41,8,1,Yeah then you can explain it
272,993.48,1002,8,3,Um I just forget the name of what it's called I don't want to like write it out
273,996.75,999.01,8,1,If you have any idea you can say it actually
274,1003.17,1005.08,8,3,What's that like pattern called 
275,1005.08,1007.37,8,1,Um you can call it a sequence
276,1009.05,1016.07,8,1,Actually the blocks start with the sequence of ten plus ten twenty twenty plus ten thirty you can explain that
277,1020.51,1027.83,8,3,Yeah but there's a name for the sequence I mean you can write that out I just want to keep trying to think of the name because that would be probably easier
278,1030.92,1033.26,8,2,Once
279,1047.15,1049.73,8,3,Each block is the sum of the heaviest two
280,1050.18,1052.82,8,3,For like each new block
281,1055.76,1058.25,8,3,I don't know
282,1063.77,1066.32,8,3,Ah Fibonacci sequence
283,1067.34,1071.51,8,3,Yeah the weights are so far we have ten times
284,1071.63,1077.87,8,3,Each value to like one two three four five six of the Fibonacci sequence
285,1079.31,1083.6,8,3,So yeah that was very perceptive nice job
286,1099.02,1101.69,8,1,Fifty and eighty right
287,1128,1134.54,8,1,I type so much
288,1166.1,1168.59,8,2,And eighty so we're expecting
289,1171.53,1176.33,8,3,Yeah I mean I guess we don't really have a sequential order for
290,1177.11,1181.97,8,3,All of them except oh wait did she give us to the blocks one by one
291,1184.13,1186.17,8,3,Cause we could just say that
292,1182.72,1183.5,8,1,Did they throw it up 
293,1186.62,1190.58,8,3,They're all like ten grams times
294,1191.24,1195.74,8,3,Some number in the first one two three four five six
295,1192.92,1195.17,8,1,One two three five
296,1196.22,1200.99,8,3,Like numbers from the Fibonacci seuquence so we expect it to be ten grams times to the seventh
297,1205.16,1209.08,8,3,Um but it's just cause we don't have orders of the ones that we got first
298,1202.73,1213.71,8,1,Um I don't understant actually you say that one even if it's the same right again if you write ten into one one comma one comma two comma
299,1214.07,1217.94,8,1,Three comma five comma eight it's second Fibonacci
300,1214.23,1216.33,8,3,I don't know I'm like
301,1219.5,1224.81,8,3,But did she give us the blocks one though sorry I'm like literally half asleep right now
302,1221.83,1224.75,8,1,No it's like this and we sorted them
303,1225.23,1225.75,8,3,Ok
304,1227.01,1229.1,8,1,Let's see we don't have any other lead right
305,1229.97,1237.92,8,3,Um I mean we're definitely right it's just like how do we word it um either way is fine like the way we have it there it
306,1235.25,1235.59,8,1,Yeah 
307,1235.58,1236.73,8,2,Makes sense
308,1238.01,1242,8,3,I mean it's it's it's not super accurate but it
309,1239.08,1240.42,8,1,It's the same actually 
310,1242.36,1245.42,8,3,Says the same thing so we might as well just do that
311,1250.07,1252.05,8,1,Yeah it's done
