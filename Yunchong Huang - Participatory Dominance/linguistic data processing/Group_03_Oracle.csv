0,11.82,27.57,3,4,Ok so the test that you are going to be completing today oh I can take those consent forms sorry thank you the test you are going to be completing today is the weights test
1,28.2,32.67,3,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of these blocks
2,33.39,38.04,3,4,We will tell you that the weight of the red cube is ten grams
3,38.76,42.57,3,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using this scale
4,43.68,46.5,3,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams
5,46.86,50.43,3,4,You don't need to use the slider or anything 
6,51,58.38,3,4,And the the weights aren't always perfect so like if it's teetering it's probably fine
7,58.44,60.57,3,4,Like it it drops one's probably heavier
8,61.35,64.23,3,4,Um and then
9,64.26,75.69,3,4,You will place the cubes on the worksheet where you think they are and you will also record your answers here on this survey here on the computer. You guys will be group three
10,77.91,80.37,3,4,And you can now start the survey
11,80.55,86.25,3,1,Alright so shall we
12,86.43,87.67,3,1,Prepare things for this one
13,88.25,89.4,3,3,Yeah
14,112.41,114.39,3,1,So you think they're the same weight or
15,116.13,118.17,3,1,They're still teetering
16,144.5,147.27,3,1,I think they're the same weight yeah
17,142.38,145.07,3,2,I think they are same weight
18,148.62,150.2,3,1,So
19,148.62,149.75,3,3,So  
20,149.24,150.25,3,1,So the 
21,151.25,152.4,3,2,Right here right
22,152.43,155.22,3,3,Um  
23,160.57,162,3,3,So 
24,159.15,160.56,3,1,So
25,162.4,165.36,3,3,The blue one is also ten right
26,165.45,167.82,3,3,So I should indicate it as ten
27,165.45,165.67,3,1,Right  
28,168.99,171.72,3,1,Um I'm going to see if there's a lighter one
29,186.96,192.42,3,1,The suspense is killing me it takes forever
30,214.42,219.93,3,3,Yes it's probably twenty so green one is twenty
31,212.13,214.16,3,1,Sufficient to say that one's probably twenty or
32,219.96,226.53,3,2,Then well uh no uh I want to check if any block is thirty so
33,219.91,224.42,3,1,What do you want
34,232.32,235.65,3,1,I think that's a good guess
35,236.34,238.32,3,2,So
36,238.47,240.45,3,2,The purple one is thirty
37,241.8,243.42,3,3,Purple is thirty yeah 
38,243.66,246,3,2,Which is blue and which is purple
39,246.36,247.42,3,2,Hold that purple
40,246.36,250.86,3,1,I think this is more purple-y yeah
41,248.5,250.25,3,3,This is blue maybe 
42,251.49,253.47,3,1,Um
43,254.04,264.18,3,1,This one feels just a smidge heavier yeah try that one
44,264.21,266.16,3,3,Green is twenty right
45,265.65,268.29,3,2,Green and this one
46,269.35,272.58,3,3,Green is twenty and purple is thirty so it weighs to fifty
47,274.95,277.05,3,1,It seems to be
48,277.53,279.75,3,3,Yeah I mentioned here green is twenty
49,277.92,281.43,3,2,It's leaning more this side so
50,285.18,287.82,3,2,It's leaning more to the side
51,288.93,294.3,3,3,So how about yellow
52,298.35,300.96,3,2,Then green is twenty and they weigh
53,295.29,298,3,3,Uh put both of these
54,302.91,305.34,3,3,Yeah just to confirm
55,305.46,309.58,3,1,Wait purple is how much purple was thirty
56,309.08,310.8,3,3,Purple is thirty
57,314.1,315.58,3,3,Yellow is of course not ten but
58,316.41,317.43,3,1,And green is 
59,318.6,320.58,3,1,Twenty
60,326.85,330.69,3,1,Have we tried these two and the green one cause it's
61,331.05,333.57,3,1,Kinda dipping
62,336.06,338.42,3,1,Nope that's too light ok too light
63,337.33,341.55,3,3,No so when we try these both 
64,344.01,348.36,3,3,So I feel yellow is fifty
65,345.75,347.42,3,1,That is equivalent to the 
66,356.19,359.46,3,3,This has thirty and twenty
67,359.91,362.94,3,3,Yeah green is twenty and purple is thirty
68,366.06,371.16,3,2,It's for sure not thirty
69,371.49,378.24,3,1,So if you put the purple and just to verify that all of our weights are correct
70,378.27,380.25,3,1,Uh
71,396.69,404.73,3,1,It must be this right because comparing it to forty it's
72,399.16,402.03,3,3,Fifty yeah
73,400.01,400.5,3,2,Fifty  
74,405.48,407.64,3,1,Not that heavy
75,408.93,411.03,3,1,So are we done
76,413.94,415.92,3,1,Try it
77,427.92,430.44,3,3,Twenty green yeah
78,432.25,433.84,3,3,Yeah and this is fifty
79,431.58,435.75,3,2,Thirty and yellow is fifty
80,435.78,440.73,3,2,Maybe we should try those things here
81,435.78,447.87,3,3,Just place the color on top
82,444.78,445.75,3,1,Try what then
83,450.33,451.5,3,4,And have you guys filled out the survey
84,451.65,452,3,2,Yes
85,452.33,453.93,3,3,Yeah until fifty
86,461.81,466.8,3,3,Uh just till fifty so should I sumbit it
87,459.84,461.08,3,4,Um did you submit the answer
88,469.65,473.16,3,3,Correct red is ten blue is ten
89,479.75,489.87,3,4,Ok so for the next part if the test you are going to determine the weight of this block without using the scale to get the answer
90,473.7,477.58,3,3,Green is twenty purple is thirty and yellow is fifty yeah good
91,485.58,486.66,3,1,Oh fun
92,490.23,492.21,3,4,And you can begin now
93,497.58,500.34,3,1,Think it's a little heavier than the yellow
94,518.79,522.48,3,1,Is there a way for us to test it other than just our
95,522.84,524.82,3,1,Perception
96,532.53,536.73,3,3,I think this is a bit more heavier and
97,537.54,539.52,3,3,So
98,541.83,547.11,3,3,Maybe ninety or a hundred
99,548.37,559.95,3,1,I bet there's a scale app on our phone and I bet it's cheating to download that
100,553,553.82,3,4,It's cheating
101,567.39,569.61,3,2,Yeah it could be eighty ninety
102,570.91,574.89,3,3,I think it is between ninety to a hundred
103,569.88,570.75,3,2,Eighty to ninety
104,576.3,581.25,3,3,Because yeah green is twenty thirty and fifty right so
105,581.31,583.86,3,3,Maybe a hundred or so
106,587.04,590.67,3,1,Is it twice as heavy as the yellow one I can't tell
107,589.42,590.67,3,2,No it's not 
108,591.45,596.94,3,1,Are the wait which one was the fifty one it was the it was yellow ok
109,594.17,596.94,3,3,Fifty is yellow yeah
110,599.13,601.83,3,2,It's not twice as heavy as yellow
111,609.12,612.06,3,2,I think it's between eighty and ninety
112,616.05,621,3,1,I have a question ok somebody like hold the yellow and the brown like
113,621.09,631.11,3,1,and your eyes and just kind of like hold them really flat and close your eyes for a second and tell me when the yellow tell me when this hand feels the same as the other
114,632.55,634.83,3,3,This is heavier I can
115,635.58,638.4,3,1,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same
116,643.5,645.41,3,1,Still lighter
117,643.66,648.78,3,3,I think yeah it does
118,648.96,652.58,3,1,I was trying to take the the visual input out of it
119,651.25,654,3,3,I think it is ok now
120,654.33,656.16,3,1,You think that's about the same
121,654.18,654.35,3,3,Yeah
122,657.24,664.5,3,3,Yeah I feel that can you even try that because yeah
123,660.83,664.5,3,1,Yeah yeah try it try it again
124,669.27,671.25,3,3,How do you feel this one is lighter
125,674.82,677.82,3,1,I feel like this like might be a smidge heavier but
126,678.12,683.79,3,1,Like the right my right I feel like that one could be a smidge heavier but
127,683.94,685.92,3,1,I don't know hang on
128,689.1,691.08,3,3,I'll just check now
129,692.01,693.99,3,1,Now I feel like the right side
130,694.62,696.6,3,1,Definitely heavier right
131,697.47,708.48,3,1,It's hard to tell it's hard to tell they're really close they're really close yeah give it a shot ok so here's our heavy one
132,700.75,745.01,3,3,It's it's your turn you have to try now you have to try
133,708.99,710.97,3,2,Ok
134,713.04,720.99,3,2,I think this is heavier now I was thinking like if you have
135,714.42,715.42,3,3,Oh my god   
136,717.08,718.17,3,1,Definitely not
137,721.26,726.18,3,2,Does uh like heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster
138,727.29,730.17,3,2,It's the same
139,731.37,734.1,3,3,But where do we get that now
140,738.66,741.42,3,3,Does this really heavier than this for sure
141,737.88,742.59,3,1,I think we would have to have really good measures yeah yeah
142,755.07,757.98,3,3,Can get that one
143,771.17,777.81,3,1,I feel like there's gotta be a clever way like an answer I don't know what it is
144,769.05,772.84,3,3,Ok I think it would be ninety or something
145,786.87,790.86,3,2,Now I think it might be hundred but
146,792.92,801.9,3,3,Yeah in between ninety and hundred but when we see normally when we compare those both but it is not showing that it is exactly double or something
147,791.37,791.92,3,2,Maybe ninety to 
148,803.08,805.44,3,1,Can I see your phone actually
149,802.41,802.83,3,2,Yeah it's not double 
150,809.31,813.42,3,3,Wow
151,817.66,824.16,3,2,I think we had place on our block here so it won't fall directly
152,816.92,820.25,3,3,Oops put both at a time maybe
153,828.33,830.31,3,3,I'll remove that red one
154,831.78,840.21,3,1,I feel like that's close enough that's close enough right
155,831.78,839.66,3,3,It's yeah that's really a great idea yeah
156,840.24,844.83,3,3,Just once remove this block
157,846.08,849.39,3,1,So it's still pretty even it's still pretty even
158,849.9,854.52,3,3,Purple is thirty even we are getting that
159,852.42,853.84,3,2,Seventy it's just seventy
160,858.03,861.99,3,3,Oops
161,862.2,864.63,3,1,We just got it balanced too well I think
162,882.9,886.74,3,1,Yeah it's pretty far to this side right now
163,887.49,890.91,3,1,Fourth try
164,891.08,892.92,3,3,We'll do one thing
165,899.19,901.35,3,1,Oh yeah
166,914.7,915.42,3,1,It's leaning that side 
167,915.91,919.11,3,3,Yeah it's leaning that way ok let me put this
168,921.63,923.91,3,2,It's eighty
169,927.15,930.33,3,3,It's leaning still leaning that side just remove one
170,934.02,939.54,3,1,What ok so this one's fifty and thirty
171,936.58,938.08,3,3,Fifty and thirty
172,940.17,943.35,3,2,If you have like if you keep twenty
173,945.12,949.77,3,2,It should it does still leaning
174,961.32,965.31,3,3,I'm thinking to just remove this once
175,965.79,971.49,3,3,So now it's leaning this way if we put that it's leaning this way ninety
176,969.41,970.33,3,2,So it's ninety
177,972.32,973.68,3,1,What if
178,971.7,971.92,3,3,Maybe 
179,974.3,978.78,3,1,Yeah I was going to say stick that here let's uh try this
180,973.71,974.66,3,3,Ok let me   
181,990.84,996.09,3,1,So then theory do we have these positioned the same
182,996.12,998.37,3,1,In theory we think this should be
183,999.06,1001.04,3,1,Yes  
184,1006.23,1008.33,3,1,We're close either way we're close
185,1008.25,1010.25,3,3,Yeah
186,1011.27,1013.88,3,3,It's definitely not hundred so
187,1014.81,1020.42,3,2,It's nintey see even for that its
188,1017.16,1018.33,3,1,I think that's  
189,1021.11,1023.93,3,2,It's same see uh
190,1024.62,1026.6,3,2,Here it started dipping
191,1029.83,1034.73,3,1,If only our block was a little just narrow sliver
192,1026.75,1029.16,3,2,What if you removed the ten
193,1038.24,1041.75,3,2,I think it's eighty now
194,1042.05,1042.42,3,1,Yeah
195,1042.16,1044.12,3,3,Yeah but when it but 
196,1046.28,1051.32,3,3,It's even the same it's this annoying climate ok let me try put in this
197,1047.42,1050.42,3,1,That looks that looks more even to me 
198,1052.28,1054.35,3,3,Oops
199,1054.65,1064.31,3,1,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right
200,1054.83,1059.92,3,3,It's the same ok
201,1064.4,1066.56,3,3,Is it ok
202,1071.57,1080.81,3,1,It's I think I think this one's this block is just too flat
203,1076.25,1079.75,3,3,Yeah it's maybe let's try it with the smaller one then
204,1083.99,1086.33,3,1,Just to test like
205,1086.75,1089.72,3,1,Yeah I think it's
206,1090.32,1095.54,3,1,They're just too sturdy and flat it's like hard to tell
207,1095.84,1098.9,3,1,We can definitely rule things out but I think uh
208,1099.74,1102.17,3,1,Too crude of a measurement to to
209,1102.44,1105.44,3,1,Narrow down that like ten gram window
210,1110.48,1113.69,3,1,Do we want to say eighty
211,1113.78,1117.35,3,3,I'm confused between eighty and ninety
212,1133.08,1135.47,3,1,Yeah it's too balanced
213,1136.01,1140.99,3,1,Like have another object
214,1144.16,1145.64,3,3,Uh there's a scale
215,1142.61,1143.83,3,1,Are we allowed to use
216,1146,1161.36,3,1,Well we're not even allowed to use the scale I say we give it our best guess at this point um
217,1155.66,1158.34,3,3,So what should I answer this 
218,1173.27,1175.64,3,3,We have two attempts to do this
219,1175.85,1185.58,3,1,Ok we have two attempts oh well then let's maybe we just try eighty and see if that's right and if it's not then it rules out
220,1175.85,1188.87,3,3,Yeah we have two attempts eighty eighty is good for three ninety yeah I'm just clicking on eighty
221,1191.3,1198.41,3,3,Oh it's right eighty yes
222,1191.3,1198.41,3,1,Oh we got it it's right eighty yeah
223,1198.5,1201.29,3,4,Ok for the final part of the task
224,1201.44,1206.6,3,4,Read the scenario in the next slide and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block
225,1206.99,1210.83,3,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
226,1211.83,1215.83,3,3,Uh the factory that creates wooden blocks did not send us a second mystery block
227,1218.33,1220.31,3,3,Weights so the second block
228,1224.81,1223.58,3,1,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right
229,1227.5,1236,3,3,The second yes yeah so we have to use only this
230,1237.44,1244.92,3,1,Well I assume we can use the second the first mystery block as a data point
231,1240.92,1247.04,3,3,The first mystery block this is eighty we could just 
232,1247.22,1247.91,3,1,Yeah
233,1248.75,1250.88,3,2,Uh I how
234,1251.12,1254.33,3,2,Like they have two one forty grams
235,1254.51,1268.76,3,2,So it must be a set so we should be able to make every possible weight here with these blocks they have one fifty two
236,1262.75,1266.66,3,1,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got 
237,1268.82,1271.1,3,2,Maybe
238,1272.27,1275.92,3,2,Maybe we must be able to do every weight here
239,1276.5,1282.02,3,3,Yeah the highest we can make is a one fifty we can make a one fifty even
240,1282.86,1288.58,3,2,And we can make it up to one fifty so if we find a block which can make
241,1288.41,1291.65,3,1,So with all of these we can make it up to one fifty
242,1293.03,1298.01,3,1,Ok yeah eighty plus fifty fifty and then yeah ok
243,1298.55,1308.63,3,2,We have ten two tens we have twenty we have thirty we can make forty with these three we can we have fifty
244,1309.08,1312.83,3,2,We have fifty with sixty sixty these two seventy
245,1312.83,1314.06,3,3,Sixty and these two
246,1314.21,1318.58,3,2,We have eighty we can make ninety we can make
247,1315.92,1322.07,3,3,We can make ninety a hundred even one ten even
248,1322.73,1325.94,3,2,One ten ok one twenty
249,1326.75,1330.42,3,3,Yeah we can it's thirty and ten
250,1329.15,1334.28,3,2,Yeah this is four ok one twenty is done 
251,1335.92,1340.33,3,3,One thirty is automatically fifty plus eighty
252,1334.55,1341.96,3,2,And uh one thirty yeah fifty ok
253,1343.08,1348.38,3,3,One forty obviously we can make that and one fifty
254,1342.17,1346.66,3,2,And then ok 
255,1350.501,1353.42,3,1,So we want to guess one fifty is that
256,1348.5,1350.58,3,3,And yeah we can make everything
257,1358.22,1363.05,3,3,We have two oppurtunities for that even so
258,1363.11,1374.9,3,3,Whatever like how did we guess eighty like we used only two blocks even for measurement of everything we just used two blocks so I'm thinking
259,1375.02,1377.81,3,3,If we just used only two blocks then
260,1377.93,1380.87,3,3,The highest two blocks may weigh something
261,1381.35,1388.85,3,3,One thirty yeah because we measured this with the help of
262,1381.33,1384.25,3,1,And that would be one thirty right 
263,1388.94,1390.92,3,3,These two
264,1392.09,1397.94,3,3,And with this we measured with these two and with this we measured with the help of these two
265,1394.33,1397.94,3,1,Wait wait wait
266,1399.11,1399.84,3,3,We almost
267,1399.75,1401.36,3,1,The instructions
268,1401.72,1403.7,3,1,We had to they're not the instructions
269,1403.91,1406.13,3,1,The waiver we signed said
270,1407.21,1409.19,3,1,Fibonnaci block test
271,1409.97,1414.62,3,2,Yes it's a Fibonnaci series
272,1414.68,1417.5,3,2,One one twenty then
273,1417.77,1423.01,3,2,Thirty thirty plus twenty fifty fifty plus thirty eighty eighty plus fifty one thirty
274,1418.91,1424.37,3,3,Thirty fifty eight one thirty
275,1424.73,1429.26,3,3,Ok let me try one thirty
276,1429.62,1431.9,3,3,And
277,1433.22,1435.08,3,3,Oh what should I index
278,1435.58,1436.33,3,2,The fibonacci series
279,1454.75,1458.72,3,3,Sounds good ok I'm submitting this
280,1464.63,1465.5,3,1,It means we're awesome
281,1464.83,1467.17,3,3,Ooh that's great that's good
