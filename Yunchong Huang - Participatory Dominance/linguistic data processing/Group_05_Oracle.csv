Utterance,Start,End,Group,Participant,Transcript
0,1.89,3.87,5,4,Callibrate my cameras
1,11.55,14.79,5,4,The task you are completing today is called the weights task
2,15.48,20.04,5,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of the cubes in front of you
3,20.25,22.68,5,4,I can tell you that the red cube is ten grams
4,23.58,35.19,5,4,No don't write it down you can flip that piece of paper over and uh you will be placing the blocks where they go on the sheet and you will also be filling out this survey here
5,23.58,24.25,5,3,Can we write that down
6,35.31,37.29,5,4,You guys are going to be group five
7,37.71,45.87,5,4,Um the scale is not perfect and the blocks aren't always perfect so like it might teeter but that's fine if one drops that's like what you want to look for
8,46.92,49.53,5,4,Um and you also don't need to touch the slider at all
9,49.59,55.83,5,4,Um so yeah just place the cubes on the worksheet as well as fill out the survey as you go and you guys can get started
10,59.08,56.94,5,1,Where's the survey
11,57.18,58.09,5,4,It's on that computer
12,58.15,59.46,5,1,Oh
13,59.73,61.91,5,3,We're group five
14,60.08,64.08,5,1,Alright Reese you can fill out the survey on the end over there ok so we know this is ten grams
15,62.91,64.62,5,2,So we know this is ten
16,65.43,67.67,5,3,Let me reset the scale
17,65.43,74.13,5,1,So you hold that at the end of the scale yeah it goes here ok
18,68.88,74.02,5,2,So we know this is ten set it there for privacy
19,74.96,84.46,5,1,What's this one ok so ok so we know that that one's heavier so ok this one looks relatively the same size so should we see
20,74.85,79.84,5,2,We just want to go pretty pretty heavy 
21,77.25,85.57,5,3,It's heavy yep
22,85.05,85.92,5,3,Sounds right
23,85.25,86.12,5,1,So we could put that there
24,92.25,95.19,5,1,I'd say that's basically the same because it's teetering
25,95.79,99,5,3,Yeah if that's what we're going off of
26,99.78,101.76,5,1,Yeah because it continue right
27,105.42,107.92,5,3,Yep it's an amazon scale we're fine
28,108.33,112.17,5,1,Ok so yeah that scale so these are both ten
29,108.58,112.17,5,2,So these are both ten   
30,112.62,113.02,5,3,Correct
31,113.19,119.55,5,1,Ok so what if if I had that is it one of those that one
32,129.66,131.51,5,1,Yeah yeah I think that's fine
33,131.62,132.99,5,2,So that one's twenty
34,133.33,136.65,5,2,So these are both ten in theory ten ten twenty
35,133.23,134.17,5,1,Ok in theory
36,137.25,147.84,5,2,Yeah so we know the blue is ten yeah
37,137.25,139.67,5,3,So we have there is no red
38,139.81,147.84,5,1,Well no red is given to you that's why you don't need well this is blue that's purple ok
39,147.96,154.32,5,3,So the green we think is twenty ok so let's see we can use our hands as well
40,149.68,151.01,5,2,The green is twenty
41,154.47,159.75,5,1,This is heavier than this one so this is twenty this is heavier than this one
42,156.5,157.58,5,2,Which one is heavier
43,160.38,161.33,5,2,This is definitely the heaviest
44,161.42,163.86,5,1,Ok so let's try purple
45,164.07,168.25,5,1,Ok so that's heavier ok ok so greather than twenty
46,167.06,170.07,5,3,So we have twenty
47,168.46,170.07,5,2,It's greater than twenty
48,170.23,172.5,5,2,So I can put one one and see if it's thirty
49,170.1,173.01,5,1,Right what if we put ten on that
50,174.48,183.63,5,2,Teeter teeter we know it's less than forty and greater than twenty so it's likely thirty we don't have any other options it it's gonna be thirty
51,175.5,181.24,5,1,What if I do this ok so less than forty likely thirty ok
52,184.5,186.08,5,1,Yeah ok so we think purple's thirty
53,185.33,186.08,5,3,Purple's thirty
54,185.92,187.23,5,2,Purple's thirty
55,188.67,199.23,5,2,And then this one obviously is is um purple and yellow this one's yeah it's it's a lot more definitely ok so it's it's more than thirty wait so this one's thirty
56,187.35,197.24,5,1,Ok and then so if I take this one off yeah thirty put that's going to be heavier more a thirty plus twenty
57,199.38,200.84,5,1,Thirty twenty
58,200.25,201.26,5,2,Plus twenty
59,205.77,218.67,5,1,This looks almost a little bit heavier but it is it's close enough so fifty is not an option yeah definitely let's put sixty
60,207.25,218.67,5,2,Yeah so I think fifty because this is fifty right definitely less than sixty
61,207.34,211.67,5,3,Yeah I'd make it a five if we had a five option 
62,218.73,226.08,5,2,And this is thirty right and this is ten so that would be forty so it's more than forty and less than sixty so it's gotta be fifty
63,223.92,229.77,5,1,Less than sixty it's gotta be fifty yeah so ok if we filled this out
64,225.75,226.67,5,3,Yellow fifty
65,229.83,230.33,5,3,Ten ten
66,231.34,233.31,5,2,Ten ten twenty
67,231.95,232.33,5,1,Twenty
68,233.58,236.64,5,1,I think this is fifty and this is thirty
69,235.08,235.92,5,2,I think that's fifty
70,236.79,241.5,5,1,And then here let's confirm this a little this here
71,242.34,246.57,5,1,Yeah let's go thirty ok so that's thirty
72,244.17,246.57,5,2,And that one's thirty thirty
73,246.78,248.76,5,1,And then like this
74,249.72,253.59,5,2,I mean I don't I don't think we need to confirm this but we just do that one so I think we're
75,251.92,252.65,5,1,Yeah that's fine
76,254.13,256.11,5,1,Ok cool
77,257.33,259.01,5,1,Yes yeah do you want us to fill it out 
78,256.2,257.01,5,4,Have you filled that out on the survey
79,257.38,259.92,5,3,Yes should I click through it
80,260.01,264,5,1,Well do you want us to hit like the next button right
81,260.01,264,5,3,All the way ok cool
82,266.91,269.49,5,2,Ten ten
83,277.55,285.58,5,4,Ok now you will determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale you will have two attempts to get the right answer and you can now begin
84,270.27,287.13,5,1,Fifty was yellow twenty was yeah we were right oh another block so we hit next on here
85,277.85,273.83,5,3,Green was twenty yep nice
86,289.33,293.88,5,2,So now we need to figure out just by holding them in our hands
87,287.31,289.17,5,1,On the qualtrics survey ok hit next
88,294.42,295.75,5,2,I guess we'll just start with the ten
89,295.17,297.15,5,1,We'll start with this this is definitely heavier than this
90,297.21,298.01,5,2,It's definitely heavier than yellow
91,298.55,300.84,5,3,Can I see yeah
92,297.75,298.5,5,1,Here
93,309,311.01,5,3,Cool I would say it's almost twice as heavy
94,309.58,314.19,5,1,Ok yeah that's what I was kind of thinking but let's see
95,316.35,319.95,5,1,Ok alright so what if we what if we this is eighty
96,317.44,318.42,5,2,This is fifty
97,320.16,328.02,5,2,What if we flip it down there's a letter
98,331.17,335.64,5,1,I would say this is still heavier I would say brown is still heavier than eighty
99,344.13,347.37,5,2,Yeah it's still heavier definitely
100,346.41,347.27,5,1,Yeah
101,347.55,349.95,5,2,I think so
102,348.02,349.85,5,1,Go ahead
103,359.1,361.59,5,3,Yeah I agree I think
104,362.07,364.92,5,3,I'm not very good at hand weight but yeah I'd say
105,363.92,368.1,5,1,Ok yeah so now   
106,368.25,372.41,5,2,This is how much that's thirty fifty thirty twenty so that's a hundred
107,368.67,372.17,5,3,Uh so fifty thirty twenty
108,372.5,374.04,5,1,This is a hundred
109,376.41,378.39,5,1,That's really close actually
110,388.59,393.21,5,1,You try it's close I don't know if it's exactly but it might be
111,393.33,395.88,5,1,We'll have to add one of these and see
112,397.02,403.25,5,3,Maybe we'll try taking off the lighter of that block and do one ten under and then do that block and do one over
113,401.25,405.69,5,1,That's ninety well no well I think this might still be heavier this way
114,405.75,407.73,5,3,Ok
115,407.94,500.15,5,2,I can't tell they're really close
116,500.25,413.52,5,1,Yeah they're close go ahead
117,418.5,421.25,5,2,I mean we know it can't be zero since
118,416.73,418.9,5,3,Feels identical
119,500.92,422.64,5,1,Ok cool
120,425.58,428.01,5,1,Ok alright  
121,428.79,431.08,5,3,Yeah I still say brown is
122,430.06,432.39,5,1,Add that to that add that
123,434.83,442.23,5,3,I would still say brown is heavier it might be a different way of measuring with the palm instead of your fingers but
124,432.78,438.59,5,1,No yeah yeah that was right yeah so add ten grams
125,452.58,454.83,5,3,I'd still say brown  
126,454.98,456.96,5,1,Still heavier you think
127,459.54,463.38,5,3,The distribution's kind of off when you hold them not in a straight line
128,460.9,461.34,5,1,Yeah
129,463.92,465.15,5,1,Go ahead
130,465.94,469.05,5,2,Give it a shot
131,480.36,484.53,5,2,Still heavier
132,493.08,498.54,5,2,I don't know I mean they're really close it's really hard to 
133,498.75,500.73,5,2,To be sure of anything
134,504.09,509.7,5,3,It's werid cause of the distribution
135,511.08,513.27,5,1,Now I can tell that this is lighter than this one
136,513.33,515.52,5,3,So that's a hundred
137,515.76,518.64,5,1,This is yeah one ten
138,516.16,516.72,5,3,Pre red
139,522.61,526.17,5,2,What if we add one more and see if it's heavier
140,520.59,522.5,5,1,I think that's really close I think that's one ten
141,527.67,532.59,5,1,Yeah this feels almost heavier than this one I think one ten is about close
142,536.64,541.05,5,2,Yeah I think this one feels heavier
143,556.05,564.03,5,3,I can't really tell I did that initially
144,557.59,561.33,5,1,Yeah that's yeah wait well did you take the top
145,558.63,560.84,5,2,So we can you think one ten
146,564.6,566.58,5,1,Do it again now
147,568.06,572.5,5,1,That feels closer yeah ok alright so let's go put one ten down
148,567.6,573.48,5,3,That feels pretty identical yeah one ten
149,573.66,576.42,5,3,We're good
150,576.78,578.76,5,3,Cool
151,579.96,595.95,5,3,So it was ten ten twenty um so the hint is think about the relationship between the weights of the prior blocks and use that pattern to determine the weight of the mystery block it was ten ten twenty thirty fifty
152,580.02,583.5,5,1,It was not quite correct no alright alright
153,598.89,613.17,5,3,This is so no no it gets this plus this equals this this plus this equals this this plus this is or this plus this yeah so we're thinking eighty
154,598.68,609.5,5,1,These are the same this is a difference of ten is this a difference of fifty no it is these and this
155,608.67,613.02,5,2,So this plus this equals this 
156,613.26,616.26,5,1,Yeah I mean that makes sense it would move here
157,616.73,630.58,5,2,I mean we can we can I guess we could feel it ok you know what this does feel pretty close I think maybe the distrubtuion just messed us up
158,619.75,623.5,5,3,That's weird that or are we sure that purple is still twenty
159,616.62,630.69,5,1,I mean it's green so it makes sense yeah because we got the answer wrong yeah maybe
160,634.2,637.02,5,2,If I hold these together more
161,638.35,646.71,5,2,I think it's just hard cause these are these two are like separate so it feels different I don't know I I it's hard to tell
162,647.35,648.09,5,1,That makes sense
163,647.13,649.11,5,1,He's right
164,652.65,668.33,5,2,I think it's just the extra blocks like having them be seperate blocks just makes it really hard to tell you know which is heavier I only grab by the base right
165,658.88,671.13,5,3,I'm trying to do randomization without here spin them for me yep put them right between my fingers
166,660.64,671.31,5,1,That didn't work yeah you would have to ok alright
167,674.25,677.01,5,2,I'm going to grab both of these by the base
168,682.74,688.91,5,1,Ok let's go with that let's go with eighty yeah
169,683.88,689.4,5,3,I'm not great at handheld weighting cool
170,699.11,698.55,5,4,For the final part of this task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you may now continue the survey
171,692.01,709.08,5,1,Eighty grams alright cool next ok
172,692.31,698.84,5,3,Eighty nice next
173,715.34,718.32,5,3,The factory that creates the wooden blocks did not send us the second mystery block
174,712.38,714.01,5,1,Go ahead and read it I can't read it from here
175,718.35,729.51,5,3,You have two oppurtunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one to two sentences how you determined your estimate indicate the weight of the second mystery block yep
176,726.64,728.76,5,1,If we decide to continue on the pattern
177,729.78,732.81,5,1,One thirty weight makes sense
178,732.99,735.48,5,3,So the pattern is
179,736.53,750.69,5,1,The summation of the previous two which actually makes sense because this ten plus 0 is ten ten plus ten is twenty well yeah but yeah
180,745.75,747.75,5,2,So we're thinking it's like the Fibonacci series then  
181,737.93,749.78,5,3,Of the previous two oh sure yeah pretty much it's the same idea
182,751.86,757.84,5,3,It is actually one one two three five eight one three so you're right it is literally the fibonacci 
183,754.67,761.42,5,1,One one yeah it is the fibonacci ok so go with that we're thinking one thirty
184,763.08,764.7,5,2,One thirty because
185,764.85,768.15,5,1,Yeah go ahead and explain it how you think
186,784.62,796.74,5,2,It's weird because these all together still feels light because you like yeah I think you understand its different blocks or this doesn't feel heavy but when have one small thing that's the weight of all of that it feels heavier that's the weird thing
187,800.13,805.01,5,3,How do you spell Fibonacci F I B O N A C C I
188,803.75,805.33,5,2,Fi B O N A C C I
189,805.5,806.09,5,1,Yeah that sounds right
190,849.39,853.92,5,1,Typing so diligently
191,854.04,860.38,5,3,Yeah that's one thing that CS has made me better at being precise ah
192,857.18,859.67,5,1,That's good
193,860.57,862.2,5,2,Did you accidentally swipe back
194,862.95,866.01,5,4,What happened
195,867.66,878.7,5,3,No it's the Chromebook if you swip on one side of it ok we know it's the pattern the increasing way the blocks is pattern it's the Fibonacci sequence
196,866.52,871.67,5,1,Did you do the wrong button oh there you go it saved it
197,882.36,889.56,5,3,By continuing the pattern for the second mystery block we got mystery block two
198,890.34,900.78,5,3,Equals prior heaviest block plus the one before that so now the equation is mystery block two equals eighty gram plus fifty gram equals one thirty gram cool
199,894.52,903.69,5,2,So this one yeah sounds good 
200,900.75,901.75,5,1,Sure put that in
201,903.93,904.84,5,2,Fibonnaci sequence
202,904.96,906.03,5,3,Cool
203,906.51,907.08,5,2,And is one thirty
