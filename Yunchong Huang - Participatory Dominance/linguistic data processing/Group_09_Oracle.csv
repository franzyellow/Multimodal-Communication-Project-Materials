0,2.43,5.7,9,4,Gonna callibrate my cameras
1,12.39,16.2,9,4,Ok the task you are completing today is called the weights task
2,16.74,21.03,9,4,In the first part you guys are going to work together to determine the weights of these cubes
3,22.14,24.27,9,4,The red cube is ten grams
4,24.69,28.35,9,4,You are going to determinet the weights of the remaining cubes using this scale
5,29.1,33.12,9,4,Uh the weights are all in intervals of ten so you don't need to use the slider at all
6,33.39,36.42,9,4,All of the weights er ah sorry the scale is not perfect
7,36.66,41.1,9,4,So as long as it doesn't drop to one side the swaying is probably even
8,42.57,46.89,9,4,And if you can place the cubes on the worksheet as you go as well as fill out the survey
9,47.46,52.77,9,4,Alright here you guys are going to be group nine and you can go ahead and get started
10,54.15,57.66,9,3,Let's go
11,61.74,63.4,9,2,I would say that's equal probably
12,63.51,65.73,9,3,Looks equal yeah get
13,77.08,77.75,9,1, I would say that's equal
14,77.85,79.58,9,3,Yeah it should be same I guess
15,78.25,79.01,9,2,Yeah that 's good
16,79.83,82.33,9,1,Yeah ok so that one will go
17,91.05,93.03,9,3,I think it's the
18,96.66,97.83,9,2,Yeah it's probably equal
19,103.33,105.99,9,1,So we got ten ten
20,107.83,108.58,9,3,That's not
21,108.23,111.27,9,1,Definitely not equal
22,121.26,122.25,9,2,Ok  
23,123.02,123.5,9,1,Sweet
24,130.26,133.35,9,1,That was twenty and ten right ok
25,131.58,132.83,9,3,That was twenty ten yep
26,133.38,135.67,9,1,Look we have the thirty gram block and then
27,135.33,136.77,9,3,I think yep
28,137.46,140.04,9,1,And then we can do
29,140.7,146.1,9,1,The two the yellow and green I don't know just kidding
30,160.22,164.84,9,2,Just like ever so slightly though so it's probably probably say that's equal
31,161.92,164.17,9,1,Oh yeah ok oh never mind ok 
32,159.72,167.91,9,3,I think it's sixty so this one was twenty
33,168.42,170.83,9,3,This one was thirty so this should be fifty less
34,171.75,173.75,9,1,Ok good deal
35,174.81,176.91,9,3,And then  
36,186.51,188.61,9,3,Yellow is
37,203.76,205.74,9,3,Can I do it
38,205.8,206.85,9,2,Yeah think so
39,206.97,207.99,9,1,Yeah yeah looks right
40,210.81,215.88,9,3,So it is ten yellow is fifty that's right green is twenty
41,216.03,222.27,9,3,Yeah we are right which one is mystery block
42,228.38,232.56,9,4,Ok now you will determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale
43,226.17,227.15,9,1,Ah
44,232.59,238.62,9,4,You will have you will have two attempts to uh enter the weight correctly and you can now begin
45,232.59,233.83,9,3,Without using scale
46,243.39,247.29,9,3,Interesting it's heavier than that one so
47,251.64,254.22,9,3,It's heavier than this too as well
48,265.44,265.99,9,3,Maybe
49,266.42,266.67,9,1,Maybe
50,266.92,267.95,9,2,I don't know if I trust you
51,272.49,276.51,9,3,Maybe it will right I'm not sure
52,279.15,281.37,9,2,Honestly this one feels heavier still
53,280.15,280.83,9,3,Yeah
54,281.67,292.59,9,3,I feel like I'm going to do a comparison between like how heavy this one feels compared to was this the this was our heaviest right before oh the yellow one's heaviest compared and then compared to
55,288.33,290.17,9,3,No the yellow one is the heaviest
56,298.56,306.24,9,1,Yeah I feel like oh we got all the way up to like one forty ok just kidding I thought it was just up to seventy I was like we'll just go with our maximum
57,308.76,314.07,9,3,Yeah so I guess it's fifty plus thirty eighty then forty
58,314.34,318.24,9,3,One twenty it's higher than one twenty at least so maybe
59,318.3,318.92,9,3,I don't know this
60,319.65,321.04,9,2,I'd say it's probably at least one forty
61,321.01,321.99,9,1,So one forty
62,327.15,329.79,9,3,It can't be one fifty or we'll have the option of one fifty
63,322.86,326.03,9,1,The red on the bottom for us
64,333.63,336.51,9,2,I don't think it's one thirty
65,336.99,340.35,9,3,Ok so it's either one forty and one fifty ok
66,337.92,339.42,9,2,I feel like yeah
67,340.71,342.63,9,3,Let's go with first start with one forty
68,341.82,345.51,9,1,Let's do one forty we'll split the difference but not really
69,352.22,355.14,9,3,So we were wrong I guess then one fifty
70,351.42,251.11,9,1,I'd go with one fifty then
71,355.56,357.54,9,2,That's what I would say
72,368.01,374.61,9,4,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block
73,360.33,365.91,9,3,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's 
74,361.17,367.17,9,1,Eighty that's not right it's
75,374.88,379.04,9,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
76,389.08,384.87,9,3,Um it's saying unable to connect our servers please shut internet servers and try again
77,387.69,389.92,9,2,Like no shot this is eighty grams
78,392.42,393.3,9,1,Abosolutely no way
79,394.26,396.17,9,2,Unless they lied like
80,396.02,400.53,9,3,Yeah ok there's a mystery block two
81,397.5,398.91,9,1,Maybe
82,417.72,420.63,9,1,So we have a second mystery block that we don't know the weight of
83,420.75,421.05,9,3,Yeah
84,421.25,422.73,9,1,Could we just
85,423.15,425.5,9,1,Haven't we don't even have at all ok
86,424.5,427.38,9,3,Yeah we just have to guess
87,430.65,432.66,9,2,So we we have two tens
88,433.11,441.39,9,3,Yeah that was fifty um was twenty and this one was thirty
89,433.33,434.01,9,2,Two tens
90,434.08,436.58,9,1,What was this like was that fifty
91,441.48,444.24,9,3,This one was two eighty
92,454.41,459.18,9,2,I mean if you like sum these two you get that one and if you sum these two you get this one
93,456.83,458.08,9,3,Yeah um
94,459.42,462.78,9,2,Sum these two you get that one so this one should be eighty
95,460.38,461.92,9,3,So it's kind of fibonacci series
96,464.04,465.52,9,2,And then these two should be one thirty
97,464.04,466.67,9,3,One thirty
98,467.67,469.38,9,1,I would say that's sound logic
99,476.16,481.17,9,3,What do you want me to write
100,481.59,482.92,9,2,Um that's fibonacci series right
101,482.83,486.51,9,1,Yeah fibonacci sure yeah seems like fib
102,487.33,484.42,9,1,Unless it's not
103,492.66,495.17,9,2,Some mathmatical thing
104,493.92,497.7,9,1,Some sort of counting upwards by combining them
105,500.46,502.89,9,3,Call it swerve yeah
106,502.92,506.76,9,3,Fibonacci
107,506.79,509.76,9,2,I think there's two c's in there
108,513.33,515.31,9,2,I I really don't know actually
109,515.43,518.52,9,3,Me neither looks right are you alright
110,515.92,520.95,9,1,Looks kind of right yeah I like it
111,523.02,523.75,9,3,Yeah you alright
112,524.17,526.98,9,2,Yes yes
113,524.56,524.85,9,1,Yes
