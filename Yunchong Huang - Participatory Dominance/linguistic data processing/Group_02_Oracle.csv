0,2.88,5.91,2,4,Callibrate my cameras real quick
1,14.82,18.18,2,4,So the task you are completing today is called the weights task
2,18.75,23.1,2,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weight of these five cubes
3,23.52,32.73,2,4,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams yep and you're going you're going to flip the piece of paper um
4,27.15,28.38,2,2,Can we use this piece of paper
5,33.3,36.42,2,4,You are going to determine the rest of the weights using them
6,36.45,38.76,2,4,Using the scale um
7,39.48,45.21,2,4,And you don't need to use the slider on the scale just like round up to whatever like zero so you don't have to worry about like 23
8,46.83,54.78,2,4,Um and then go ahead and place the scale on the worksheet when you've gotten the weight and also enter it into this survey
9,54.9,57.3,2,4,You guys are going to be group two
10,57.63,58.83,2,4,And you can go ahead and start
11,59.58,65.92,2,2,Alright you guys mind if I just start some tests
12,60.84,68.01,3,1,Ok cool no for sure
13,81.33,85.53,2,1,Yeah it's like a bit slow to level up
14,86.82,88.95,2,1,So I would imagine if this
15,88.98,91.58,2,1,Needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal
16,92.58,94.65,2,2,And I I think they are
17,94.77,97.05,2,2,Especially since it keeps going back in a
18,97.11,102.39,2,1,Yeah they also just look like relatively the same size but they could be different material you know
19,97.37,98.25,2,2,Even length
20,104.08,106.23,2,1,So that one is probably ten grams too
21,102.45,104.75,2,2,Yeah
22,108.06,111.3,2,1,And then if that's ten grams then we have a two
23,112.29,117.87,2,2,So I'm going to hold back on that one because I think it's the heaviest
24,115.73,116.17,2,1,Yeah
25,119.13,120.16,2,1,We can do like the
26,120.5,121.59,2,2,The green one
27,121.74,123.9,2,2,By touch feels lighter
28,124.68,127.02,2,2,And that looks like it might be about even
29,133.83,136.17,2,1,Ok
30,138,140.31,2,1,There we go that's better
31,141.27,146.91,2,2,Well on the first go through I noticed how it bounced twice and actually get some momentum ok so then
32,144.92,149.08,2,1,Yeah so that's probably twenty grams
33,149.97,151.95,2,1,You'd imagine and then
34,152.31,153.75,2,1,The first two are ten
35,154.58,155.34,2,2,Yep
36,155.49,158.1,2,2,Um
37,158.13,164.17,2,2,So knowing that uh oh sorry the green one was yeah
38,164.31,165.67,2,1,Twenty probably
39,165.56,166.59,2,3,Yeah
40,167.13,169.11,2,3,This is what we are looking at next
41,169.26,171.42,2,2,Yeah
42,192.69,195.87,2,1,So you know twenty plus ten thirty probably
43,195.93,199.5,2,2,Yeah but it still feels like it's leaning towards the two blocks
44,199.75,200.82,2,1,Oh yeah it does
45,216.87,220.01,2,1,I guess it's leveling out a bit more but
46,220.25,221.25,2,2,Yeah
47,221.4,225.41,2,2,I guess and there's no increment so five so we could probably just go with thirty on that
48,222.5,227.46,2,1,Yeah yeah closest like
49,227.7,230.91,2,1,Accuracy wise so then you know
50,231.42,233.46,2,1,You can do the same process with
51,233.61,236.49,2,1,Putting this on that side checking this one
52,237.51,241.77,2,1,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right
53,247.95,250.17,2,2,So that's the twenty and the thirty
54,255.36,258.01,2,2,It's leaning towards one side a bit much
55,258.08,260.67,2,1,Yeah we could probably try it with just ten
56,264.3,268.65,2,1,Oh not enough so probably
57,266.91,267.33,2,2,Ok
58,269.61,271.59,2,1,Twenty then
59,271.92,275.16,2,2,Oh yeah the twenty and the thirty so we'll go with the fifty
60,272.5,274.25,2,1,Yeah and the thirty so fifty
61,285.15,287.16,2,2,Alright
62,288.12,290.1,2,1,Wait did we mix these up or 
63,290.16,291.07,2,2,No
64,293.66,294.75,2,3,So these are both ten
65,291.91,296.1,2,1,I got no good ok
66,297.06,297.75,2,3,Blue or purple
67,298.74,299.64,2,1,Um
68,300.51,302.82,2,1,I think purple or
69,303.75,309.48,2,2,This would be blue this would be purple yeah I thought they were both blue until
70,303.15,307.25,2,1,Blue yeah no I see that's like a navy blue
71,309.87,311.85,2,2,Question was asked
72,332.49,334.47,2,3,Are we supposed to write on the worksheet
73,335.41,338.13,2,4,If you guys have gotten to the end of that we can
74,334.86,335.33,2,2,Um
75,339.06,340.5,2,2,Ok yep
76,338.52,338.91,2,4,Over
77,339.16,339.42,2,3,Ok
78,343.98,346.75,2,2,Wait a mystery block
79,347.25,348.63,2,4,So
80,351.21,353.19,2,2,Without the scale
81,353.28,357.36,2,4,For the next part of your task you will determine the weight of this mystery block
82,358.26,361.53,2,4,Scale you will have two attempts to enter the weight correctly
83,358.34,358.74,2,2,Ok
84,362.16,363.08,2,4,You can now continue the survey
85,362.16,368.79,2,2,Alright uh we are allowed to use the other blocks in holding the weight
86,381.48,384.42,2,2,Ok so this block is heavier than our fifty
87,384.57,387.39,2,1,Oh yeah much much more
88,419.43,421.68,2,1,Yeah I mean that seems pretty similar
89,429.78,430.58,2,1,That also seems similar
90,432.08,433.47,2,2,Do you want to give it a shot
91,443.04,445.71,2,3,Like all of these
92,456.42,458.4,2,2,All of these together is going to be
93,458.5,458.66,2,2,Fifty  
94,468.03,468.42,2,2,Twenty  
95,468.66,470.55,2,1,Yeah cause that's
96,470.94,473.52,2,1,Forty plus thirty seventy
97,473.58,475.65,2,1,And fifty right
98,477.27,478.57,2,1,So yeah  
99,478.01,480.78,2,2,Yeah we got the two tens
100,481.35,483.66,2,2,Twenty
101,484.65,486.63,2,2,Thirty and then fifty
102,490.2,492.18,2,1,So it's probably
103,492.42,494.97,2,2,I might shoot all the way for the one forty
104,492.66,493.42,2,1,Yeah
105,495,498.57,2,1,I think it's a bit more than the max
106,498.84,502.35,2,1,So yeah probably maybe one forty plus or minus ten
107,502.65,504.63,2,2,Ok is the
108,502.92,504.58,2,2,Actually either one thirty
109,504.87,507.72,2,2,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper
110,513.15,518.4,2,1,No ok maybe we should do one thirty and then
111,513.15,515.18,2,4,No
112,518.88,521.67,2,1,Or one forty and then one thirty if we think
113,522,530.37,2,1,I don't know that's kind of my thought process um
114,524.42,530.37,2,2,I was thinking one forty first as well but um
115,527.5,528.95,2,3,Is it one fifty on here
116,536.82,543.24,2,2,Honestly I still feel like we should go with one forty first and if not we should actually move to one thirty
117,543.33,546.12,2,2,Sorry one fifty since it's on there
118,548.13,548.52,2,3,One forty
119,549.5,550,2,1,Yeah
120,549.75,550.71,2,2,Yeah
121,555.15,557.19,2,1,Is it wrong
122,557.43,560.52,2,2,Not quite correct
123,561.12,563.42,2,2,One more attempt alright
124,524.42,566.28,2,1,So plus or minus ten right
125,567.03,569.85,2,1,So we can try and
126,580.53,583.02,2,1,I don't know it's probably better if the same hand
127,583.92,585.9,2,2,Yeah
128,592.16,597.32,2,2,I'm feeling the one fifty personally but
129,590.79,591.33,2,1,I don't know I mean
130,595,597.51,2,3,Wait what it it again when it's lined up
131,598.75,602.55,2,2,That's a ten ten that's a twenty
132,597.9,599.5,2,1,Um think yeah these are ten
133,602.91,604.98,2,2,Fifty and that's a thirty
134,607.98,612.63,2,2,And we guessed this was a one forty so our options were one thirty or
135,612.75,614.73,2,2,Off the paper
136,616.02,618,2,2,Together that's one twenty
137,623.01,624.9,2,3,I think it has to do with patterns
138,619.95,623.34,2,2,Um personally 
139,625.26,629.07,2,3,Because it says think about the relationship between the weights of the power blocks
140,629.67,632.49,2,3,And if you do like
141,629.58,630.03,2,2,Oh yeah
142,637.71,639.99,2,3,These add up to twenty
143,640.29,642.9,2,3,These add up to thirty these add up to fifty
144,644.79,647.37,2,3,But that doesn't really make sense either I don't know
145,647.49,649.47,2,1,Yeah I mean this could be
146,649.98,655.71,2,1,This set of two adds up to this one and then the next set of two adds up to that
147,655.86,661.77,2,2,So these would add up to eighty and then eighty plus fifty would be one thirty
148,656.5,658.58,2,3,So it would be eighty and you weigh less
149,664.32,666.3,2,3,And thirty 
150,673.68,676.8,2,3,I think it's just the last two so it would just be fifty and thirty
151,677.25,680.28,2,3,I think it just feels like it's
152,680.52,684.83,2,3,A lot heavier because it's denser and like just carrying that
153,682.33,683.66,2,1,Yeah that might makes sense
154,684.83,686.01,2,2,Were we right then
155,686.58,689.04,2,3,No you're wrong it was eighty
156,689.13,690.47,2,3,Cause I think we did one step too much
157,689.58,671.17,2,1,Yeah it's a pattern
158,691.9,692.04,2,2,Really
159,694.74,696.72,2,4,Have you guys finished the second one
160,697.05,698.25,2,1,Um yeah we just finished
161,697.5,700.29,2,3,Is is the yeah mystery block
162,708.83,715.11,2,4,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the
163,715.23,719.25,2,4,Second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer
164,726.81,730.89,2,3,Well that was our one thirty right because that was fifty
165,731.43,733.44,2,1,Yeah so
166,733.56,737.28,2,1,That makes sense yeah fifty and eighty one thirty
167,741.39,747.66,2,1,And then like every set of two I guess and the next block will be the set
168,747.78,753.15,2,1,The like sum of the two previous blocks
169,760.68,763.32,2,3,In order to like
170,763.77,765.75,2,3,Least heavy to most heavy or
171,765.96,772.68,2,1,I guess heaviest to least heaviest maybe because these two add up to that one
172,772.95,775.05,2,1,These two add up to that one
173,775.65,781.08,2,1,These two I guess it doesn't matter which order it's just the sum of the previous two
174,777.95,778.5,2,3,Yeah
175,777.83,778.5,2,1,Yeah
176,783.27,785.49,2,1,And yeah I guess in order of
177,784.33,784.84,2,2,Um
178,785.42,786.66,2,1,Wait yeah
179,801.27,801.92,2,3,Ok we're done
180,801.75,803.25,2,1,Alright cool
