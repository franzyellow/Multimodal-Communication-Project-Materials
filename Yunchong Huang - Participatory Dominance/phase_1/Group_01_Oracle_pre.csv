1,1,9.87,12.45,1,4,Alright so,0,0
2,2,12.63,15.75,1,4,The task that you are doing today is called the weights task,0,0
3,3,16.2,21.36,1,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weight of 5 cubes,0,0
4,4,22.17,24.27,1,4,Um and then,0,0
5,5,24.42,27.72,1,4,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams,0,0
6,6,29.08,29.83,1,1,Ok yeah  ,0,0
7,7,29.84,31.32,1,4,So uh,0,0
8,8,31.44,34.56,1,4,You don't need to touch the slider on the scale don't worry about that part at all,0,0
9,9,35.01,36.99,1,4,Oh,0,0
10,10,37.83,47.82,1,4,So you have to place sorry please place the scales place the cubes on this worksheet where you prove that they weigh again yes,0,0
11,11,48.27,52.25,1,4,And uh as you are filling it out if you guys can fill out the survey you will be group one,0,0
12,12,52.58,54.84,1,1,Oh and we don't touch the scale yet,0,0
13,13,54.93,58.29,1,4,Um you can touch the scale just like there's a slider,0,0
14,14,58.33,58.84,1,3,It's right there,0,0
15,15,59.22,60.92,1,4,But like you dont need to do anything with the slider,0,0
16,16,60.66,62.49,1,1,Ok so you want us to,0,0
17,17,62.58,65.18,1,1,Use the scale to determine the weights ok cool,0,0
18,18,64.91,69.66,1,4,Yes um and if you guys can fill out that survey like as you go because you'll be submitting answers on there,0,0
19,19,69.81,71.51,1,1,Where's the survey oh ok,0,1
20,20,70.51,70.01,1,3,Um it's turned off,0,0
21,21,72.25,73.53,1,4,Oh,0,0

23,23,77.51,77.75,1,2,Ok,0,0
24,24,78.08,80.58,1,1,Ok well it would be nine minus ten,0,1
25,25,78.58,78.08,1,3,One,0,0
26,26,80.58,84.3,1,2,That's ten so then,0,0
27,27,86.07,87.41,1,1,Just like put it on,0,0
28,28,87.48,89.04,1,2,Does the slider move,0,0
29,29,90.12,92.13,1,1,Hold on lets just uh,0,0
30,30,95.19,97.17,1,3,It seems pretty balanced,0,0
31,31,97.56,102.03,1,1,Yeah ok so now we know that this is also ten,0,0
32,32,102.39,105.87,1,1,Um ok so now,0,1
33,33,104.08,104.58,1,2,Ok,0,0
34,34,106.23,110.01,1,1,What would we maybe put that one on there too,0,1
35,35,108.63,109.33,1,2,Cool,0,0
36,36,110.16,114.24,1,1,And then see if there's thats twenty which is not,0,1
37,37,112.16,112.92,1,2,It's more,0,0
38,38,114.87,120.33,1,1,Lets try this one oh gee louise this one,0,1
39,39,117.41,118.25,1,3,No  ,0,0
40,40,121.2,125.01,1,1,Ok lets just oops sorry,0,0
41,41,127.35,132.0,1,2,Ok so this one is probably twenty ten ten twenty,0,1
42,42,128.83,130.08,1,3,Yeah seems about twenty,0,0
43,43,128.41,130.75,1,1,Ok so ten ten twenty,0,0
44,44,132.27,139.65,1,1,Ok so now lets start at thirty alright put one of those on there,0,1
45,45,135.33,135.91,1,3,Yes  ,0,0
46,46,135.73,136.41,1,2,Yeah thirty,1,0
47,47,140.73,145.89,1,1,Ooh its looking like thirty,0,1
48,48,142.91,144.92,1,2,Probably thirty at this point,0,0
49,49,148.86,159.42,1,1,Ok so we got ok yeah this one is really heavy so lets do the a this and a ten,0,1
50,50,149.25,154.25,1,2,Yeah ten ten twenty thirty,0,0
51,51,153.21,155.25,1,3,Twenty thirty forty,1,0

53,53,162.91,163.86,1,1,Yeah,0,0
54,54,164.37,167.91,1,3,Fifty pounds or pounds grams,0,0
55,55,169.31,171.99,1,1,Interesting so that's ten twenty,0,0
56,56,172.56,183.58,1,1,So we said this ones thirty I still feel like that's heavier and this one is twenty,0,0
57,57,174.54,185.08,1,2,Yeah yeah the blue dark blue one is thirty that's the larger one it's slightly heavier yeah,1,0
58,58,185.33,187.83,1,3,We can replace one of these with the twenty to get,0,0
59,59,188.1,189.5,1,3,Sixty here,0,0
60,60,189.91,196.44,1,1,Ok and then put that on that one,0,0
61,61,198.15,202.14,1,2,How much is the dark blue small one ten,0,1
62,62,200.31,201.37,1,1,Ten they're both,0,0
63,63,203.49,204.34,1,1,Assuming that this was,0,0
64,64,204.58,206.37,1,2,Oh gosh I think I got them mixed up,0,0
65,65,207.06,210.87,1,1,Yeah Im thinking that it's ten ten twenty thirty,0,0
66,66,211.29,213.93,1,1,So what have we done weve done forty,0,0
67,67,214.47,216.45,1,1,Um,0,0
68,68,216.63,219.06,1,1,And then we did fifty,0,0
69,69,216.16,217.66,1,2,It's just like slightly ,1,0
70,70,219.33,221.49,1,1,And then we did sixty,0,0
71,71,228.06,231.51,1,1,And now it stopped being too heavy,0,0
72,72,231.54,233.52,1,1,So this is supposedly,0,0
73,73,234.27,239.82,1,1,Thirty fourty fifty correct and it's still heavier than this thing,0,1
74,74,235.83,237.58,1,2,Fifty yeah,0,0
75,75,240.84,242.82,1,1,So have we done forty,0,0
76,76,251.88,258.72,1,1,So thirty this is also forty right so this if forty yeah,0,1
77,77,254.63,255.31,1,2,Ok so that one's twenty right,0,0
78,78,256.84,257.01,1,3,Yes,0,0
79,79,260.01,263.82,1,1,This is fifty it's not ,0,0
80,80,264.93,267.36,1,1,Yo that's close enough ok so,0,0
81,81,268.08,272.58,1,3,Yeah fifty so we say yellow is fifty,0,0
82,82,267.57,269.42,1,1,Fifty boom,0,0
83,83,274.26,280.32,1,3,And green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple,0,1
84,84,275.75,279.11,1,2,Yeah,0,1
85,85,275.83,277.75,1,1,I think that's I think that's good,0,0
86,86,281.25,283.48,1,2,I think this one is purple and this one is blue,0,0
87,87,282.25,286.26,1,3,Ok so blue is ten and purple is ,1,0
88,88,286.56,287.08,1,3,Thirty,0,0
89,89,288.92,292.47,1,1,Yes verify real quick but I think it is,0,0
90,90,288.91,289.41,1,2,Yes thirty,0,0
91,91,295.32,304.62,1,1,Yeah we got them yeah,0,1
92,92,296.48,296.79,1,2,Yeah,0,0

99,99,313.82,314.42,1,1,You're right,0,0
100,100,315.66,315.91,1,3,Cool,0,0
101,101,318.72,321.81,1,1,Ok we have finished and we were correct,0,0
102,102,321.84,323.97,1,4,Ok awesome um,0,0
103,103,324.12,339.63,1,4,You are now going to determine the weight of this block without the scale you will have two attempts to get the weight correctly,0,0
104,104,331.17,331.83,1,3,Oh,0,0
105,105,334.38,336.33,1,1,Ok definitely minimum fifty,0,0
106,106,337.08,337.92,1,2,Minimum fifty,0,0
107,107,339.87,341.85,1,4,And you can now continue,0,0
108,108,342.06,347.07,1,1,Yeah cause if you feel the yellow one oh yeah so yeah,0,0
109,109,344.01,347.07,1,3,Do we get a glass of water,0,0
110,110,350.73,351.67,1,2,Definitely heavier,0,0
111,111,351.31,351.75,1,1,Yeah,0,0
112,112,351.65,352.71,1,3,Yeah,0,0

114,114,361.23,365.07,1,1,Ooh that seems pretty good pretty close to me,0,0
115,115,365.49,367.98,1,2,How much was purple thirty,0,0
116,116,368.7,369.42,1,2,Purple was thirty,0,0
117,117,369.91,370.68,1,3,Yeah,0,0
118,118,370.86,372.84,1,2,And yellow was fifty,0,0
119,119,373.89,380.58,1,1,Yeah try picking these two up and you can close your eyes and try to hold it from the,0,1
120,120,374.64,375.25,1,3,Which would put eighty,0,0
121,121,381.48,383.61,1,1,Yeah same point maybe,0,0
122,122,383.7,384.33,1,1,I don't know its hard,0,0
123,123,385.08,388.41,1,3,I almost feel like this one is still heavier,0,0
124,124,394.62,399.66,1,2,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think,0,0
125,125,402.81,406.89,1,2,It still feels heavier but it could just be,0,0
126,126,407.58,410.37,1,3,It is definitely denser which could be skewing,0,0
127,127,410.52,412.5,1,3,Our perception of it,0,0
128,128,413.43,414.58,1,2,So right now that's ninety grams,0,0
129,129,414.91,415.83,1,1,Oh jeez yeah,0,0
130,130,416.76,420.03,1,1,And na that's freaking that's way,0,0
131,131,420.96,423.39,1,2,That's a hundred,0,0
132,132,423.87,430.47,1,1,Yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe,0,0
133,133,432.66,435.72,1,2,That does feel pretty similar give it a shot,0,0
134,134,440.4,442.53,1,3,Yeah I think its,0,0
135,135,442.68,448.16,1,3,It feels really similar and that's a hundred grams,0,0
136,136,443.66,454.47,1,1,Yeah that's a good first guess and we get two so do you think we should a consensus on that one and this is fifty,1,1
137,137,448.91,450.5,1,2,Let's do it yeah a hundred I think,0,0
138,138,455.37,459.27,1,2,Thirty twenty right ok yeah,0,0
139,139,455.37,457.5,1,1,Thirty twenty,0,0
140,140,460.26,464.28,1,1,Uh yeah so should we press the blue arrow,0,0
141,141,464.64,473.25,1,3,We're on this screen right now should we go onto the next one ok,0,0
142,142,467.91,473.25,1,1,The current weight of the last that was our first test ok,0,0
143,143,470.75,472.01,1,4,Oh yeah you can continue,0,0
144,144,473.37,479.88,1,3,Two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok,0,0
145,145,473.45,479.88,1,1,Ok a hundred ok ,0,0
146,146,481.71,485.94,1,1,That was not quite correct ok,0,0
147,147,487.11,489.69,1,3,I think it's more if it's anything,0,0
148,148,488.16,489.69,1,2,I think you're thinking more,0,0
149,149,491.07,493.59,1,3,That's less right now,0,0
150,150,493.72,495.42,1,2,Is that less right now oh,0,0
151,151,495.72,498.01,1,1,Oh yeah that is where we were at,0,0
152,152,498.5,521.25,1,2,We were at this yet ok,0,1
153,153,500.16,502.83,1,3,No that's a hundred and ten,0,0
154,154,505.68,511.29,1,1,The thing that sucks is that now we are finding about like torque and different other,0,0
155,155,504.9,505.5,1,2,Ooh,0,0
156,156,511.32,514.47,1,1,Perceptions of uh,0,0
157,157,517.02,519.24,1,2,I still think the brown one is heavier than this,0,0
158,158,525.0,526.13,1,2,It's hard to balance them,0,0
159,159,526.33,527.58,1,3,Yeah,0,0
160,160,533.01,537.3,1,1,I wonder like I don't know what that one,0,0
161,161,538.17,541.44,1,1,God yeah balances is hard I mean,0,1
162,162,539.83,540.22,1,2,Yeah,0,0
163,163,541.74,545.94,1,1,So I think definitely it's either,0,0
164,164,546.21,554.52,1,1,This or this cause we can't even make these weights so it could be above them I know but like if we are thinking it's so close to a hundred,0,1
165,165,549.41,550.5,1,3,That could be part of it,0,0
166,166,555.57,559.58,1,1,Are probably errors within yeah within this,0,1
167,167,557.58,558.66,1,3,Twenty  ,0,0
168,168,559.08,561.69,1,2,I just like tried to put all the cubes in my hand at once,1,0
169,169,562.08,563.41,1,2,No that doesn't do anything,0,0
170,170,563.42,565.26,1,1,So would you,0,0
171,171,565.59,574.71,1,2,I would say either a hundred twenty or a hundred thirty because I feel like it would be possible for it to be out of range of what we can measure but,0,0
172,172,574.92,576.9,1,1,Yeah,0,0
173,173,578.88,582.09,1,1,Yeah it's just weird,0,0
174,174,589.86,602.07,1,1,I don't know I guess I would I would vote one of these two but what do you guys think ok,0,1
175,175,598.5,600.5,1,2,Between the two I would say a hundred twenty,0,0
176,176,603.9,608.64,1,3,It feels close I just can't tell if like,0,0
177,177,609.0,612.75,1,2,So right now this is one-twenty,0,1
178,178,610.5,611.08,1,3,One twenty,0,0
179,179,618.81,623.4,1,1,Do you want to try one twenty then,0,0
180,180,623.43,628.02,1,2,Yeah it's either one twenty or one thirty for me so I think one twenty would be the best guess,0,0
181,181,630.57,641.28,1,1,Eighty grams wow yes cause margin of error interesting,0,1
182,182,632.23,638.08,1,3,What hey hey we were right about our margin of error of twenty we were just thinking in the wrong direction ,0,0
183,183,641.79,645.92,1,1,Yeah there's it's gotta be something to do with the verticality of this but yeah we failed,0,0
184,184,646.25,647.15,1,3,Yeah,0,0
185,185,650.41,652.35,1,4,Um ok so  ,0,0
186,186,652.65,655.02,1,4,For the final part of the task,0,0
187,187,655.17,666.21,1,4,Read the scenario that will come up for the next part of the survey and estimate the weight of the next block and you will again have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer,0,0
188,188,666.24,669.0,1,4,And you can now continue the survey,0,0
189,189,677.16,679.14,1,1,They didn't send us the next block,0,0
190,190,679.23,686.61,1,1,So we ok let's see the second mystery block,0,0
191,191,686.94,692.37,1,1,Two oppurtunites to estimate the weight of the second block explain one,0,1
192,192,689.91,690.92,1,3,It's the fibonacci series,0,0
193,193,694.98,697.29,1,1,That's twenty ok um,0,0
194,194,697.32,701.34,1,1,Explain in one to two sentence what I determined,0,0
195,195,702.21,707.07,1,1,Ok ok yeah so we got one one two,0,1
196,196,704.75,706.25,1,3,Yeah it's the fibonacci series,0,0
197,197,707.37,712.26,1,1,Three three plus two is five five plus two,0,0
198,198,712.75,717.67,1,2,Eight eight plus five is one hundred thirty,0,0
199,199,712.62,723.9,1,1,Wow wait so one thirty ok,0,1
