0,0,0.33,4.32,4,4,Ok I'm going to callibrate my cameras,0,0
1,1,11.67,14.1,4,4,I'm sorry I feel like this didn't catch up,0,0
2,2,14.64,16.71,4,4,Ok  ,0,0
3,3,21.05,23.97,4,1,I don't know if I have to be serious or not,0,1
4,4,21.5,22.25,4,2,That was awkward,0,0
5,5,24.96,32.4,4,4,So the task you are completing today is called the weights task in the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of the cube,0,0
6,6,33.3,36.24,4,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams,0,0
7,7,36.78,40.38,4,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale provided,0,0
8,8,41.13,45.0,4,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams so you don't need to use the slider,0,0
9,9,45.72,52.8,4,4,Um the scale is not perfect so as long as one side does not drop completely you can assume the weights are fairly equal,0,0
10,10,54.45,56.85,4,4,You must place the weights onto this,0,0
11,11,57.36,68.75,4,4,Place the cubes under the worksheet and then also fill out the survey in line as you go and you can now start oh and you're group four,0,0
12,12,66.41,70.8,4,3,Uh they are not all weight this has more weight oh we're group four so we press enter here,0,0
13,13,64.9,67.66,4,2,Ok so the red has ten,0,0
14,14,72.21,80.64,4,3,Well then no let's compare the red to the blue to see if we can get a baseline to the blue,0,1
15,15,78.08,78.33,4,2,Yeah,0,0
16,16,80.79,83.1,4,1,Well the top is a ten,0,0
17,17,83.58,83.84,4,2,Is it,0,0
18,18,85.12,86.13,4,1,Once it stops,0,0
19,19,89.82,97.32,4,1,Ok there easy so this is twenty yeah cause this is ten as long as it's not dropping it's the same,0,1
20,20,91.67,95.35,4,2,Is it ten and this was equal to this one,0,0
21,21,97.83,99.96,4,1,And then this was,0,0
22,22,103.08,103.67,4,1,Perfect,0,0
23,23,104.58,105.93,4,2,Ok,0,0
24,24,108.33,112.77,4,3,Put the twenty on there take off a ten,0,1
25,25,106.05,110.84,4,1,I feel like this one is oh yeah so this is ,0,0
26,26,110.18,111.34,4,2,Take off a ten,1,0
27,27,116.34,118.32,4,1,So it's not,0,0
28,28,119.94,125.75,4,1,It doesn't drop completely yeah we can consider this to be thirty then yeah because it doesnâ€™t drop,0,1
29,29,123.5,127.41,4,2,Can we yeah and it's obviously not forty,1,1
30,30,124.15,125.03,4,3,Can we,0,0
31,31,127.47,130.62,4,2,Well it's not and it's not twenty yeah it's gotta be thirty,0,0
32,32,127.47,127.75,4,1,Yeah,0,0
33,33,130.65,132.5,4,3,Yeah ok so that's thirty are we writing this down somewhere,0,0
34,34,134.91,136.92,4,4,No you just set the block wherever it goes ,0,0
35,35,132.58,139.95,4,2,Ok can we write on this paper oh well it's a good try to put in our head,0,0
36,36,142.5,145.8,4,4,Um you should be writing it down on the worksheet,0,0
37,37,140.61,142.31,4,2,Wait that oh yeah oh ok,0,0
38,38,142.32,143.25,4,3,And then we want ,0,0
39,39,147.06,151.89,4,1,Oh on there,0,0
40,40,155.04,161.79,4,3,Uh so yellow we or red and blue there's no there's no ok,0,1
41,41,157.84,159.83,4,1,Ok so we can say that this is fifty,0,0
42,42,160.63,161.79,4,2,Not fifty,0,0
43,43,161.88,162.59,4,1,Blue is ten,0,0
44,44,162.59,163.86,4,2,Sixty right ,0,0
45,45,164.67,167.67,4,2,Weren't those both thirty or no only one of them twenty and thirty ,0,0
46,46,165.67,170.31,4,1,No this is twenty you're off the team,1,1
47,47,168.05,169.5,4,3,Twenty and then,0,0
48,48,170.46,177.06,4,3,And so that would mean yellow is fifty,0,0
49,49,170.46,172.25,4,2,I've been cut ,0,0
50,50,175.5,177.06,4,1,Yeah,0,0

63,63,209.31,212.34,4,3,Oh there's a new thing without a scale,0,0
64,64,213.51,217.65,4,4,Now you will determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale,0,0
65,65,217.77,219.75,4,4,You will have two attempts to enter the weight correctly,0,0
66,66,220.29,226.71,4,3,Ok I vote here's my vote alright,0,0
67,67,227.07,237.63,4,3,"We each go around, we each come up with a weight ourselves and then we vote then don't look at what we do",0,1
68,68,230.25,233.84,4,2,Yeah ok I'm not going to look at what you guys do,0,0

84,84,373.95,380.1,4,3,We get any sort of feedback if we enter any correctly is it higher or lower or are we going to get that wrong,0,0
85,85,381.75,386.33,4,3,Because you said we get two attempts so will we feedback saying we were too high or too low,0,0
86,86,386.33,387.83,4,4,You will get some type of feedback ,0,0
87,87,387.99,390.33,4,3,Ok,0,0
88,88,391.14,394.05,4,3,So in that case we should change our strategy,0,0
89,89,394.11,395.92,4,3,What is the type of feedback we get,0,0
90,90,396.5,397.58,4,2,Probably not supposed to know ,0,0
91,91,410.1,412.38,4,2,Oh interesting,0,0

112,112,498.19,498.92,4,3,Do that again,0,0
113,113,495.21,499.17,4,3,Yeah you guys are right so if you do,0,0
114,114,499.26,502.17,4,3,I like how we abandoned the voting,0,0
115,115,501.05,504.06,4,2,Well I think I mean we eliminated some like,1,0
116,116,504.48,506.46,4,2,That's where I thought was pretty good,0,0
117,117,507.25,520.74,4,1,This one feels good this one for some reason feels weird yeah I know ok so fifties ten,0,0
118,118,507.15,514.83,4,2,But it's hard to say it makes it look almost lighter well I mean,0,0
119,119,512.08,520.74,4,3,Alright I'm ok with this so that's,1,0
120,120,520.86,523.84,4,3,It would be fifty plus thirty so one ten,0,0
121,121,524.44,526.11,4,2,Yeah this is pretty good,0,0
122,122,527.73,529.09,4,3,We happy with one ten,0,0
123,123,527.73,532.26,4,1,Moment of truth yeah that makes one twenty,0,1
124,124,529.33,531.25,4,2,Yeah I am,0,0
125,125,532.29,534.45,4,2,Yeah,0,0
126,126,534.87,543.06,4,3,It's not quite correct think about the relationship between weights of the prior blocks and use a pattern to determine the weight of the mystery block,0,0
127,127,543.12,553.76,4,3,Ten ten twenty thirty fifty so plus plus it's fibonnaci it's fucking fibonnaci,0,0

130,130,548.64,564.6,4,3,So ten plus ten is twenty twenty plus ten is thirty thirty plus twenty is fifty so it's eighty so I was fucking right,1,1
131,131,556.53,559.84,4,2,I saw something wasn't there something about fibonacci in the form,0,0
132,132,564.87,569.82,4,1,Yeah I guess so,0,0
133,133,570.24,577.5,4,3,Right my math is right right because thirty plus fifty is then eighty yeah,0,0
134,134,577.59,580.58,4,3,Like ok that would be this and this right like,0,0
135,135,581.38,583.41,4,2,There is weights inserted in here,0,0
136,136,584.04,587.08,4,3,All right are we happy with eighty,0,0

141,141,591.32,596.41,4,1,Is it really I guess it was hard to tell because ,0,0
142,142,598.47,605.07,4,1,Oh if we do like this we are like doing a weird balancing act we have to go right in the center of mass,0,0
143,143,605.28,610.37,4,3,Ok please update the worksheet near thefind the research where you completed this portion of the task cool we've completed this portion of the task,0,0
144,144,610.53,620.28,4,4,Ok for the final part of this task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you may now continue,0,0
145,145,620.31,623.46,4,3,The factory creates the wooden blocks,0,0
146,146,623.52,635.92,4,3,Did not send us the second mystery block you have two oppurtunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one to two seconds or one to two sentences how you determined the estimate indicate the weight of the second mystery block,0,0
147,147,635.95,639.0,4,1,It's gotta be a hundred and thirty if we are doing fibonacci,0,0
148,148,640.35,642.33,4,3,If we're doing fibonnaci yeah sure,0,0
149,149,643.02,644.58,4,3,But that's what they want us to think,0,0
150,150,644.58,646.29,4,1,TRUE,0,0
151,151,646.59,648.57,4,3,It could be,0,0
152,152,651.42,656.92,4,2,What's our sentence going to be we didn't want to follow the pattern because it was too obvious you know what I mean,0,0
153,153,650.7,664.02,4,3,Well I um there's two ends to a pattern right there's the lower end and there's the upper end this is not specifying that the mystery block is heavier,0,0
154,154,664.32,666.48,4,3,The second mystery block could be lighter,0,0
155,155,666.81,676.26,4,3,Oh no it did say that there it did say that there in scales of ten yeah ten is yeah ok oh I'm just trying to,0,1
156,156,668.22,672.17,4,1,Yeah it's gotta be heavier yeah cause,0,0
157,157,667.41,672.25,4,2,It can't yeah because the bottom one is ten x is zero,0,0
158,158,676.68,679.25,4,1,I said one thirty I feel like we can't overthink it,0,0
159,159,679.08,684.48,4,2,I agree one thirty because it follows fibonacci,1,0
160,160,685.92,690.9,4,2,No way caps lock is on a lot,0,0
161,161,690.99,692.34,4,3,How do you spell Fibonacci,0,0

169,169,707.4,715.44,4,3,I don't know I'm just going to leave it like that it follows Fibonacci because it was eighty plus fifty yeah cool alright we happy with that,0,0
170,170,714.64,715.44,4,1,Yeah,0,0
171,171,715.47,718.14,4,3,Cool alright select one thirty yeah,0,0
