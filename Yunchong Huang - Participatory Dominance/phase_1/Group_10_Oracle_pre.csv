0,0,3.9,6.4,10,4,Let me Calibrate my cameras real quick Oh I'm just,0,0
1,1,14.67,19.08,10,3,Oh okay,0,0
2,2,7.37,7.65,10,3,Sorry,0,0
3,3,15.38,18.92,10,4,Okay The test that you are completing today is called the weights test The test that you are completing today is called the weights test,0,0
4,4,19.67,23.17,10,4,In part one you will work together to determine the weights of the five colorful cubes,0,0
5,5,24.01,26.75,10,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams,0,0
6,6,27.57,30.84,10,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here,0,0
7,7,31.53,42.59,10,4,All of the weights are intervals of ten grams so you don't need to use the slider um and the scale is not perfect so as long as one side doesn't drop you can assume the weights are fairly equal,0,0
8,8,43.52,51.002,10,4,You must place the cubes onto this worksheet once you have determined their weight and also enter their weight in the survey on the computer,0,0
9,9,51.75,54.58,10,4,Uh you can now start the survey You guys are gonna be group number ten,0,0
10,10,55.33,57.08,10,3,Okay so the red is ten grams?,0,0
11,11,57.33,57.4,10,2,Yeah,0,0
12,12,57.59,58.32,10,3,Okay  ,0,0
13,13,58.47,59.92,10,1,So I suppose like,0,0
14,14,60.67,65.67,10,1,Let's assume that the bigger ones are ,0,0
15,15,66.58,70.0,10,2,Let's put two yeah Red one as well,0,1
16,16,68.25,69.5,10,1,We can put that other one here too,0,0
17,17,71.73,72.25,10,3,Hmmm,0,0
18,18,74.0,74.98,10,2,Too hard a selection,0,0
19,19,78.08,79.06,10,1,Yeah I suppose,0,0
20,20,79.58,82.08,10,3,I guess this is like twenty and this is like ten and ten,0,0
21,21,82.33,82.84,10,2,Hopefully,0,0
22,22,82.97,87.91,10,3,I mean what why didn't we first check out whether these two are equal They are of equal size but,0,1
23,23,85.41,86.17,10,1,Yeah,0,0
24,24,87.41,90.17,10,2,They're the same Uhhhh just don't want to touch it,1,0
25,25,96.5,98.0,10,3,It looks like they're fairly equal,0,0
26,26,100.0,101.08,10,2,Yeah I suppose,0,0
27,27,100.84,102.85,10,3,Right so then that's twenty these two are ten,1,0
28,28,104.33,105.32,10,2,Let's see,0,0
29,29,104.59,106.59,10,1,That would make sense to me,1,0
30,30,108.83,110.92,10,2,Just a sec let it settle for the,0,0
31,31,111.42,111.62,10,3,Mmhmm,0,0
32,32,115.17,115.92,10,3,Hmmm,0,0
33,33,117.42,119.17,10,3,Looks fairly equal to me yeah,0,1
34,34,117.46,118.87,10,2,Yeah they're together,0,0
35,35,119.75,128.25,10,3,Alright Well now let's do these two I can already tell this one's heavier yeah,0,1
36,36,119.75,129.84,10,2,Yeah they're they're equal Heavier So let's put the ten one ten,0,1
37,37,123.0,123.75,10,1,You can just,0,0
38,38,130.33,131.08,10,2,Let's put one ten,0,0
39,39,132.58,133.08,10,2,Let's see,0,0
40,40,136.34,142.91,10,1,I say they are equal Those are the instructions I suppose,0,1
41,41,138.43,139.92,10,2,Yeah fairly equal but let's see,0,0
42,42,142.92,144.13,10,3,We gotta be,0,0
43,43,145.5,146.0,10,3,Oh,0,0
44,44,146.28,150.25,10,3,Try this one out as well like after some time wait wait wait let's let's see if it balances,0,1
45,45,149.75,150.11,10,2,Yeah,0,0
46,46,151.46,153.0,10,3,Cause I have a feeling this is a little more,0,0
47,47,157.81,163.33,10,1,I'm not sure was uh just a bit more like we would be able to tell the difference,0,0
48,48,161.42,163.39,10,2,Just a second just a sec,1,0
49,49,166.41,167.67,10,3,Like you would be able to see it right?,0,0
50,50,167.39,170.0,10,2,Yeah yeah yeah yeah Just a sec,1,0
51,51,171.5,173.26,10,2,Stop now please,0,0
52,52,180.78,202.56,10,2,I'm guessing it's a little bit to the left a little bit to the left like It touches the red line but on the left hand side of the left line red it's gonna be heavier Like not equal but almost almost equal How do wait how do we know this one's twenty did we no we didn't,0,1
53,53,184.06,202.21,10,3,Yeah so let's try to put that on top and see Okay so it's definitely not like fourty Like thirty two thirty three what do you say Cause this one's twenty this one's ten Cause we did it,0,0
54,54,203.33,216.41,10,2,We we moved it and checked the two tens remember we didn't do this one Okay yeah sure sure sure yeah yeah put thirty Thirty yeah,0,1
55,55,207.46,217.0,10,3,Yeah but then when we have the two yeah Yeah yeah so I would say around thirty two or something,1,1
56,56,208.39,212.15,10,1,To begin with also like we don't really have time to do this,0,0
57,57,217.89,219.78,10,2,Thirty one thirty two so thirty,0,0
58,58,218.23,220.5,10,3,So okay Cool,1,0
59,59,223.0,225.0,10,1,Um you know what let's try this,0,0
60,60,224.72,225.48,10,3,What's left,1,0
61,61,228.21,228.74,10,3,Okay  ,0,0
62,62,234.11,235.39,10,1,Do these make sense,0,0
63,63,247.61,254.24,10,2,So this one's thirty and what's this one twenty right Twenty okay so this one's gonna be fifty okay,0,1
64,64,250.73,250.83,10,1,Twenty,0,0
65,65,250.75,251.5,10,3,Twenty Yeah,1,0
66,66,260.9,262.41,10,2,Almost there,0,0
67,67,263.83,268.91,10,3,I mean it's not gonna go anywhere I guess it's just Oh,0,0
68,68,265.91,269.13,10,2,It's more tilting to the right so less than fifty,1,0
69,69,270.0,270.72,10,3,Okay,0,0
70,70,270.0,274.0,10,2,But there's no like I mean between weights so fifty,0,0
71,71,274.24,275.81,10,1,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere,0,0
72,72,278.32,281.31,10,2,Just a sec let this settle now Yeah,0,0
73,73,280.08,283.33,10,3,This is gonna be too heavy I think this is around yeah,1,0
74,74,283.84,286.57,10,2,This is like less than fifty less than fifty,0,1
75,75,284.97,285.4,10,3,Fifty,0,0
76,76,286.92,290.71,10,3,Like if those are more than fifty then this is less Yeah,0,1
77,77,289.78,290.41,10,2,Less than fifty,0,0
78,78,295.5,301.5,10,3,I guess we're done huh I just want to feel it though I really want to see if it's the heaviest,0,1
79,79,297.14,297.73,10,1,Makes sense if,0,0
80,80,302.51,307.26,10,3,Should I Oh yeah this is fifty grams ,0,1
81,81,303.0,305.0,10,2,Yeah yeah it's it's almost settled down so it's less than fifty,0,0
82,82,307.81,312.48,10,1,So this was thirty right Thirty this was twenty and these are tens,0,1
83,83,309.17,310.42,10,2,Yeah Twenty,0,1
84,84,309.91,310.17,10,3,Okay  ,0,0
85,85,312.89,313.67,10,2,and that's fifty,0,0
86,86,313.87,314.17,10,3,Fifty,0,0
87,87,316.91,319.14,10,2,tens yeah So that's it,0,0
88,88,320.47,320.71,10,2,Hopefully,0,0
89,89,320.63,322.0,10,3,Well we have more weights here,1,0
90,90,322.72,326.0,10,3,Like one fourty But no blocks,0,1
91,91,323.25,324.18,10,1,This mandate,0,0
92,92,327.82,333.09,10,1,What are we supposed to do we are supposed do We are supposed to enter it in the laptop,0,0
93,93,329.82,334.59,10,3,Do you have more blocks or I think we're done here Oh okay let's do that,1,0
94,94,335.64,336.41,10,2,Ten I guess,0,0
95,95,335.87,337.17,10,3,Group number ten,1,0
96,96,342.68,349.0,10,3,okay Now help me out Fifty Okay green,0,0
97,97,343.5,350.5,10,2,So the yellow one's fifty Yeah Green wait green's twenty,1,0
98,98,344.52,350.68,10,1,Fifty Yeah Twenty,1,0
99,99,352.82,353.23,10,3,Okay,0,0
100,100,353.34,355.84,10,1,And they're two blue,0,0
101,101,355.32,359.09,10,2,Tens tens are blue blue and red yup,1,0
102,102,359.57,365.67,10,3,blue and reds well they don't have the right uh purple Thirty right yeah alright let's do it,0,1
103,103,361.92,363.41,10,2,Purple's this one thirty,0,0
104,104,366.42,373.25,10,1,you know what like I feel that is this what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right ,0,0
105,105,373.75,382.59,10,3,No I think this is this is the one which is purple Oh,0,1
106,106,374.0,383.09,10,2,No no no no So like they gave the weight of this one they gave the weight of the red one so that's why they didn't include this one they already gave us yeah,1,1
107,107,376.5,378.5,10,1,There are four options so,0,0
108,108,383.74,386.09,10,3,lets go ahead and hit this,0,0
109,109,387.42,390.67,10,3,red is ten grams  yellow is fifty grams ,0,1
110,110,388.42,389.17,10,2,Yeah red ten given,0,0
111,111,391.12,396.25,10,3,Green is twenty I mean we're we're right right I mean we're exactly right,0,0
112,112,394.25,397.0,10,2,Uh yeah let's see,1,0
113,113,398.25,403.09,10,3,No the red is ten blue is ten yellow is fifty Okay  ,0,1
114,114,399.5,402.33,10,2,Yeah yeah yeah we're we're right,0,0
115,115,405.01,407.59,10,2,Where is the mystery block Any idea,0,0
116,116,407.84,417.67,10,3,Indicate the weight of the mystery block Whoa Where is the blue guy,0,1
117,117,410.18,418.67,10,1,You have two attempts It's heavier than everything else,1,1
118,118,411.17,413.12,10,2,Okay okay we remove the scale,0,0
119,119,414.67,416.42,10,4,Determine the weight of this mystery block ,0,0
120,120,419.67,424.5,10,4,Um you guys will have two attempts to enter the data correctly into the survey,0,0
121,121,422.0,427.84,10,2,Two attempts okay Wait this one is what again fifty This is this is,0,1
122,122,426.08,426.59,10,3,This is fifty,0,0
123,123,428.82,430.07,10,3,That's that was thirty,0,0
124,124,429.34,430.58,10,1,Thirty Twenty,1,0
125,125,430.59,431.57,10,2,Okay just a sec,0,0
126,126,433.32,443.42,10,2,Can we form something on one side like this place the other one So okay yeah,0,1
127,127,439.15,440.63,10,3,Well just just try to get a feel of It,0,0
128,128,445.5,451.75,10,1,I would say still heavier than all these blocks Yeah can you grab there and hold it,0,1
129,129,447.5,450.84,10,2,Okay really Really,0,1
130,130,449.5,449.75,10,3,Really,0,0
131,131,455.32,456.02,10,2,Just a sec,0,0
132,132,457.59,460.34,10,2,So the yellow one's fifty,0,0
133,133,460.84,463.67,10,2,thirty twenty ten ten okay Just a sec,0,0
134,134,465.42,466.42,10,3,Almost the same,0,0
135,135,468.37,469.5,10,3,Fifty thirty twenty,0,0
136,136,470.5,474.67,10,3,hundred and ten like a hundred or a hundred and ten that would be my guess,0,0
137,137,473.25,475.0,10,2,Suppose I remove the tens ones then,1,0
138,138,475.5,478.03,10,1,Fifty thirty eighty twenty hundred,0,0
139,139,478.57,488.62,10,2,how are you how are you really holding I'm just moving blocks and seeing Yeah this is lighter this is lighter If I put the ten,0,1
140,140,478.68,479.85,10,3,This is hard to say,0,0
141,141,482.31,484.07,10,1,so like one thirty or one fourty,0,0
142,142,491.17,491.91,10,2,Still lighter,0,0
143,143,492.13,492.58,10,1,Yeah,0,0
144,144,497.23,499.0,10,2,Comparatively less lighter but,0,0
145,145,499.5,500.0,10,2,Same,0,0
146,146,502.0,505.56,10,1,Umm Do you want to try like one thirty,0,1
147,147,502.75,503.25,10,3,Let me try,0,0
148,148,505.06,509.53,10,2,Like like wait let's remove these two let's check This one is lighter right on the right side,1,0
149,149,510.91,511.41,10,2,How's your read,0,0
150,150,512.89,517.92,10,3,It's hard it really it's hard to say because it depends on how strong your hands are both hands so,0,0
151,151,519.25,526.25,10,3,I don't know like ninety or maybe a hundred you know it could be is my guess We have a hundred and ten,0,0
152,152,523.0,528.0,10,2,How much is it so we have fifty thirty eighty ten hundred hundred and twenty,1,0
153,153,528.5,535.07,10,2,Because two tens Two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put this also feels lighter right,0,1
154,154,529.58,531.84,10,3,Oh we have two okay Okay,0,0
155,155,536.56,541.42,10,1,Yeah uh maybe not Difficult it is um,0,0
156,156,539.14,542.64,10,2,Maybe not Just a sec okay,1,0
157,157,545.42,546.91,10,2,Yeah it's lighter but this,0,0
158,158,549.9,556.08,10,2,Almost same let's let's do it Yeah ,0,1
159,159,551.0,551.5,10,3,Okay,0,0
160,160,552.5,555.25,10,1,This is um this whole block is one twenty right so,0,0
161,161,556.28,556.83,10,1,Where do we wanna,0,0
162,162,556.85,561.58,10,3,I think one twenty and one ten would be a good idea because we have two chances,0,0
163,163,561.81,562.08,10,1,Yeah,0,0
164,164,562.39,568.75,10,3,Right Oh okay,0,0
165,165,563.42,569.37,10,1,I I was thinking maybe a little bit higher instead of lower but that also makes sense because I don't know any better,1,0
166,166,571.75,572.5,10,2,see this,0,0
167,167,575.0,577.25,10,2,This feels same almost try it,0,0
168,168,577.0,578.0,10,3,Oh let's try it out,1,0
169,169,581.0,589.17,10,1,It's strange that like you are saying that all of these stacked up were all identical to that and now these ,0,1
170,170,585.84,586.41,10,2,No no no no,0,0
171,171,586.17,587.67,10,3,Hundred and ten so that's like a hundred,1,0
172,172,589.42,601.34,10,2,No no no no so the thing is like when you put this it feels almost same because it's just ten gram difference that's why Let let's try it Yeah,0,0
173,173,596.5,603.02,10,3,So that that would put it at like a hundred Because that one would be a hundred and ten and this is a hundred ten so that's hundred,1,0
174,174,601.75,604.25,10,1,I mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess,1,0
175,175,606.0,609.75,10,2,fifty thirty eighty hundred hundred and ten over there,0,0
176,176,610.81,613.78,10,2,hundred and ten yeah let's put hundred and ten let's see what happens,0,0
177,177,614.67,616.41,10,3,Well If we're going to put a hundred and ten What No that's what I said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first I think we should go with a hundred and ten first Then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,0,0
178,178,615.14,627.57,10,2,No wait wait this is hundred this is hundred this is hundred So means hundred and ten is total this Yeah Okay yeah sure sure sure,1,1
179,179,626.25,626.43,10,1,Yeah,0,0
180,180,630.31,631.24,10,2,Sure let's see,0,0
181,181,635.04,637.63,10,3,Okay this is okay,0,0
182,182,637.65,638.42,10,2,Okay,0,0
183,183,640.89,651.34,10,3,Okay this is not quite correct So between the weights of the prior blocks,0,1
184,184,642.92,650.75,10,1,weights of the prior blocks and use it oh okay So these are ten ten twenty Thirty,0,1
