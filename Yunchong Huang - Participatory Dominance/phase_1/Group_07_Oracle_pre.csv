2,2,18.0,19.5,7,4,There will be content on that paper,0,0
3,3,22.25,25.23,7,4,Okay the task that you are completing is called the weights task,0,0
4,4,26.0,30.25,7,4,In part one you will work together to determine the weights of the five colorable cubes,0,0
5,5,30.9,33.5,7,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams,0,0
6,6,34.59,37.83,7,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here,0,0
7,7,39.33,43.58,7,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams so you don't need to touch the slider on the scale,0,0
8,8,44.08,49.58,7,4,The scale is not perfect so as long as one side doesn't drop down you can assume that the weights are equal,0,0
9,9,50.58,56.08,7,4,Uh you will place the blocks onto these onto the worksheet once you have determined their weight,0,0
10,10,56.84,59.08,7,4,And you will also enter the weight into this survey here,0,0
11,11,59.47,62.31,7,4,You guys are going to be group number seven and you can go ahead and get started,0,0
12,12,63.87,66.17,7,3,Do I just type in the group number now or,0,0

89,89,303.75,307.32,7,3,Yeah how about we try like twenty and then,1,0
90,90,313.42,316.42,7,1,It's it's two gram I think,0,0
91,91,316.67,318.92,7,1,It has until five but,0,0

96,96,328.84,334.82,7,1,It's mmm it's this way plus five so you can,0,1
97,97,333.07,333.33,7,3,Oh,0,0
98,98,340.08,341.85,7,3,Oh ok so it could be,0,0

100,100,347.25,347.5,7,3,Or here,0,0
101,101,347.42,350.0,7,2,So now we're adding three grams where,1,0
102,102,351.75,353.25,7,3,So we're adding,0,0
103,103,356.0,357.58,7,2,Where are we adding so wait,0,0
104,104,358.33,363.17,7,3,So if you move it there then we're adding like five grams yeah to that one,0,1
105,105,360.42,362.57,7,1,Going to this one yeah,0,1
106,106,361.42,361.92,7,2,There,0,0
107,107,363.42,369.92,7,2,No so it's divided it's two point five and two point five so it can't be other five that's not how it works,0,0
108,108,371.42,372.67,7,2,So uh,0,0
109,109,372.58,375.42,7,3,So is it to the right right now like the scale,1,0
110,110,378.21,381.52,7,3,Like the center scale is it to the right okay so,0,0
111,111,380.0,385.92,7,2,Yeah are we allowed to ask questions,1,1
112,112,381.25,383.56,7,1,But it doesn't have any,1,0
113,113,387.15,389.14,7,3,I don't are we allowed to ask questions or no,0,0
114,114,388.65,393.42,7,4,To clarify you don't need to use the slider at all they will all be in intervals of ten grams,0,0
115,115,394.0,395.75,7,3,Oh okay so,0,0
116,116,394.03,397.25,7,1,Ah yeah because yeah so it's fifty,1,0
117,117,396.5,399.0,7,2,So now we've kind of destructed everything,1,0
118,118,399.25,399.75,7,3,Okay,0,0
119,119,403.33,406.84,7,3,So if it's an interval of ten it should be forty but,0,0
120,120,408.33,411.34,7,3,It's more balanced with fifty grams,0,0
121,121,419.25,425.75,7,3,Oops oh I don't know yeah I think so,0,1
122,122,422.0,425.44,7,2,Fifty fifty,0,0
123,123,429.0,432.0,7,3,Otherwise uh like it wasn't balanced with,0,0
124,124,431.52,432.33,7,1,It's slightly off,1,0
125,125,433.33,435.05,7,2,It's slightly to the left that's what it,0,0
126,126,436.02,436.17,7,3,Yeah,0,0
127,127,438.41,441.62,7,3,But like the scale isn't properly aligned as well so,0,0
128,128,441.41,444.42,7,2,It could be forty but can we measure forty,1,0
129,129,445.5,448.5,7,3,So so green,0,0
130,130,445.67,449.42,7,2,So that is thirty plus ten so that is purple,1,0
131,131,450.5,452.75,7,2,Purple plus red I guess,0,0
132,132,452.33,452.84,7,3,Okay,0,0
133,133,457.21,458.84,7,2,No Okay I think it's fifty,0,0

145,145,513.63,517.17,7,4,Okay you will now determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale,0,0
146,146,517.67,520.41,7,4,You will have two attempts and you can now begin the survey,0,0
147,147,520.91,521.42,7,3,Okay,0,0
148,148,523.66,524.75,7,2,Without using,0,0

158,158,558.08,561.25,7,2,So is it also in like multiples of ten the weight,0,0
159,159,561.66,561.71,7,4,Yes,0,0
160,160,593.42,600.5,7,1,Do you need help Ok you go,0,0

188,188,731.83,740.16,7,2,So this is eighty okay So what do you think How did you hold it,0,0
189,189,733.03,741.16,7,3,Yeah I think I thought like even all of these combined were Like this,1,0
190,190,741.92,743.75,7,2,Like that like on three fingers,0,0
191,191,742.42,744.13,7,3,Yes like yep,1,0
192,192,747.25,748.0,7,2,Okay so ,0,0

194,194,752.75,758.83,7,2,One two three fingers I guess it might matter which fingers we're holding with I don't know,0,0
195,195,758.08,760.84,7,3,Yeah like how about you try and,1,0
196,196,766.16,767.42,7,2,Oh maybe I'll try holding it here,0,0
197,197,767.66,768.16,7,3,Okay,0,0
198,198,773.25,774.5,7,2,It kinda feels the same,0,0
199,199,775.0,778.75,7,2,Can you put it on my these two fingers,0,0

201,201,793.25,793.43,7,3,Yeah,0,0
202,202,802.57,803.59,7,1,Because I think,0,0
203,203,805.09,817.33,7,2,It's very difficult I don'­t know what side it is Like if you pick it up like this so this is why I felt it is seventy is because I was holding it like this ,0,1
204,204,806.59,812.33,7,1,Because it's not just when we weighed it's not just the weight it's could be,0,0
205,205,817.67,821.16,7,2,But now it does feel heavier actually now that you mention it,0,0
206,206,821.5,822.0,7,3,Yeah,0,0
207,207,824.5,829.84,7,1,So how about those two I had Eh these two,0,0
208,208,829.05,832.0,7,3,Uh Green was Twenty this is thirty this is fifty,1,0
209,209,838.09,839.33,7,2,Yeah still feels heavier,0,0
210,210,839.42,839.92,7,3,Yeah,0,0
211,211,841.66,841.91,7,3,How about,0,0
212,212,843.87,846.41,7,2,Is there a better way to measure it,0,0
213,213,847.39,853.16,7,3,Like if we were just measuring like one block we could just drop it to the ground the heavier one would fall first,0,0
214,214,854.21,854.42,7,3,Yeah,0,0
215,215,854.33,856.58,7,1,Or juggling like this,1,0

217,217,866.83,869.15,7,3,So you said eighty and you think,0,0
218,218,869.42,873.5,7,2,no I said seventy but now it could be more I don'­t know,0,1
219,219,869.66,871.0,7,1,I think it should be ,0,0
220,220,874.25,880.54,7,2,Actually feel this is equal to the combined weight of all of this now Is there,0,0
221,221,883.09,884.83,7,2,Is there for which part of the hand is more sensitive,0,0
222,222,886.33,890.09,7,3,Like it's generally this one,0,0
223,223,891.16,892.56,7,3,Like the palm I think,0,0
224,224,897.25,899.02,7,2,This feels very heavy okay,0,0
225,225,901.25,904.75,7,3,How about you hold this in one hand and what we'll do is like,0,0
226,226,905.33,907.58,7,2,Can we like use a string,0,0
227,227,909.33,910.09,7,2,No but we can't,0,0
228,228,912.33,913.66,7,3,Oh sorry no go ahead,0,0
229,229,914.41,925.16,7,3,So what if you like put this in one hand and we like had move like one block from like the other hand to this hand and see if whether it becomes heavier or lighter,0,0
230,230,927.09,927.75,7,3,Uh Okay,0,0
231,231,933.5,939.33,7,3,So Yeah I'll put this here,0,0
232,232,939.91,942.58,7,2,I don'­t think the palm is the most sensitive,0,1
233,233,942.09,942.15,7,3,No,0,0
234,234,943.68,948.66,7,2,So if there was a way to hold it like this I think this is more sensitive,0,0
235,235,949.0,949.27,7,3,Okay,0,0
236,236,950.94,952.93,7,2,This is definitely heavier I feel like,0,0
237,237,955.0,956.33,7,3,Uh I would right now,0,0
238,238,958.09,977.5,7,1,I forgot the name of that but in the physic when you have eight under um larger area what was that Sorry Uh no no the name of that in the physic Perhaps I can see the,0,1
239,239,968.16,981.5,7,3,Uh pressure Uh oh Uh I don'­t think we can we use our phones or,1,1
240,240,969.16,971.5,7,2,Surface area surface area,0,0
241,241,980.85,984.61,7,1,At least I want to see a word No it's okay,1,0
242,242,986.58,990.18,7,1,Density yeah I think density,0,1
243,243,988.01,988.23,7,3,Yeah,0,0
244,244,995.5,997.54,7,2,It could be the same can you try it now or,0,0
245,245,999.0,1006.09,7,2,So I uh maybe I'll try removing weights and I'll add also weights and then we can try to callibrate,0,0
246,246,1004.28,1006.54,7,3,Okay yeah yeah,1,0
247,247,1013.71,1015.18,7,2,Just keep trying different things,0,0

249,249,1019.49,1020.47,7,3,Seems closer,0,0
250,250,1023.78,1032.59,7,2,I think we should try very fast so that you become more aware before you get used to it Then how about this,0,1
251,251,1026.36,1032.25,7,3,Yeah yup uh I don't know uh,0,0
252,252,1035.92,1040.61,7,3,I think good yard uh yeah this one,0,0

257,257,1057.33,1062.09,7,3,But it could be this much or like with like,1,0
258,258,1062.11,1070.82,7,2,Like plus or minus Do you want to try that So hold it like that because it's more sensitive,0,1
259,259,1063.59,1067.21,7,3,Yeah Yeah Yeah like they're so,0,0
260,260,1068.42,1068.59,7,1,Okay,0,0

337,337,1385.92,1387.17,7,3,I think this was twenty,1,0
338,338,1389.97,1392.73,7,3,Let's uh change this,0,0
339,339,1400.25,1400.5,7,2,Heavier,0,0
340,340,1401.0,1402.34,7,3,This is okay,0,0
341,341,1403.41,1404.14,7,3,And,0,0

351,351,1444.42,1445.92,7,3,This is heavier the right side,0,0
352,352,1450.86,1457.59,7,2,You can always uh like your right hand side you can always put it down and pick it up again because you might get used to it,0,0
353,353,1458.12,1458.59,7,3,Okay,0,0
354,354,1460.61,1462.09,7,3,Seems similar,0,0
355,355,1462.68,1466.13,7,2,Sort of can you put down the right side and pick it up again,0,0
356,356,1469.83,1472.11,7,3,Yeah no this is heavy Yeah,0,1
357,357,1471.26,1472.0,7,2,Right side is heavy,0,0
358,358,1473.0,1479.79,7,2,Okay stop stop Because I felt that was heavier you felt that this was heavier So we neeed to,0,0
359,359,1477.57,1484.11,7,3,Yeah No uh when you felt it was heavier it was like this three blocks,1,0
360,360,1485.09,1490.38,7,2,These four you mean Was it So it means,0,0
361,361,1486.36,1494.38,7,3,Uh yeah these four blocks not the green one Yeah So it's between like these two,1,0
362,362,1494.82,1507.39,7,3,How about you try uh like try it with this one since we know like that this is the heaviest that we know of we put some random ones uh,0,0
363,363,1515.42,1516.13,7,2,This feels heavier,0,0
364,364,1518.79,1521.31,7,1,Really but it wasn't,0,0
365,365,1521.53,1528.34,7,3,Yeah Okay so Okay,0,1

367,367,1532.59,1535.07,7,3,This one which one feels similar,0,0
368,368,1538.66,1542.09,7,1,I think we should callibrate for example these,0,0
369,369,1548.27,1555.57,7,1,No we should callibrate like this and we put other thing and we remove one thing,0,0
370,370,1556.0,1572.98,7,3,Yeah I think that is a good idea like we use same weights initially and then add like different Yeah yeah but you need to like keep your eyes closed for that,0,1
371,371,1563.66,1570.52,7,1,And we add and we don'­t say to you that what we add or we and finally we find,0,0
372,372,1572.67,1576.75,7,2,These are equal this is thirty and this,1,0
373,373,1574.56,1577.75,7,1,And we just um mix this together,1,0
374,374,1577.27,1581.5,7,3,That is fifty this is twenty yes and this is thirty,1,1
375,375,1579.34,1579.84,7,2,Oh this is fifty,0,0
376,376,1582.84,1584.09,7,2,Fifty twenty thirty,0,0

378,378,1585.92,1588.17,7,2,Also let's do a combine together,0,0
379,379,1587.92,1596.0,7,1,No no just start with these and we add different things until you said they are equal Okay take these two,1,0
380,380,1598.79,1598.84,7,1,Just  ,0,0
381,381,1606.09,1606.59,7,2,Feels the same to me,0,0
382,382,1608.09,1608.63,7,3,Okay,0,0
383,383,1609.83,1614.19,7,1,So you should feel those at first that they are,0,0
384,384,1620.49,1621.46,7,2,This is heavier,0,0
385,385,1622.57,1625.59,7,3,Okay uh how about now,0,0
386,386,1631.33,1631.83,7,2,This is heavier,0,0

389,389,1644.98,1645.71,7,3,And now,0,0
390,390,1652.79,1653.59,7,2,Same,0,0
391,391,1654.0,1659.84,7,3,Okay I okay could you like put them down yeah,0,0
392,392,1660.09,1664.33,7,1,It doesn'­t feel correct,0,0
393,393,1663.59,1666.66,7,3,I don'­t okay so like,1,0
394,394,1667.92,1681.0,7,2,So that but this is equal This is fifty ten sixty sixty plus six so this is ninety,0,1
395,395,1670.56,1678.39,7,3,So if like these feel similar so Fifty Thirty,0,0
396,396,1681.59,1687.59,7,2,And this is Thirty ninety minus thirty sixty,0,0
397,397,1683.0,1687.92,7,3,Ten twenty thirty is sixty,1,0
398,398,1688.46,1689.42,7,2,Should we lock sixty,0,0
399,399,1690.96,1691.73,7,1,Which one was fifty,0,0
400,400,1692.19,1693.46,7,3,Uh this one was fifty,0,0
401,401,1694.49,1695.18,7,2,You're sure about that right,0,0
402,402,1695.95,1696.21,7,3,Yeah,0,0
403,403,1698.58,1702.0,7,2,Let's since we already have something let's close your eyes,0,0
404,404,1706.0,1707.0,7,1,I should feel like this,0,0
405,405,1721.29,1724.37,7,3,Which one is heavier Yeah,0,1
406,406,1723.75,1724.0,7,1,This one,0,0
407,407,1727.28,1729.0,7,2,This was in the same group right,0,0
408,408,1732.09,1732.62,7,3,How about now,0,0
409,409,1733.33,1736.11,7,1,It's heavier It's this one,0,0
410,410,1734.64,1736.73,7,2,Which one Left one,1,0
411,411,1737.48,1737.67,7,1,This one,0,0
412,412,1737.87,1744.33,7,3,Your left hand yeah ok this is heavier ok uh,0,1
413,413,1739.18,1743.67,7,1,Yes Yeah I feel heavier,0,1
414,414,1740.69,1741.19,7,2,It's heavier,0,0
415,415,1747.82,1748.23,7,3,How about now,0,0
416,416,1754.0,1757.02,7,1,I feel heavier Left one,0,1
417,417,1755.89,1756.35,7,2,Which one,0,0
418,418,1758.1,1760.37,7,3,Okay how about now,0,0
419,419,1766.25,1766.64,7,1,The same,0,0
420,420,1767.41,1773.0,7,3,Okay okay uh you can put them down So we have like this is twenty,0,1
421,421,1770.87,1771.75,7,2,This is how much,0,0
422,422,1774.5,1777.89,7,3,So we have like two answers and we have like two tries,0,0
423,423,1778.64,1786.41,7,3,So uh this is the Nah I think I'm good Yeah we've got like uh,0,0
424,424,1780.94,1792.67,7,2,Do you do you want to try it again So this is uh either sixty or or eighty right,1,0
425,425,1789.47,1794.58,7,3,So twenty plus thirty fifty uh,1,0
426,426,1797.0,1801.86,7,3,So like the first option is sixty which or eighty,0,1
427,427,1799.89,1801.0,7,2,Or eighty right because,0,0
428,428,1802.59,1805.0,7,2,Because this was heavier that means it has to be eighty,0,0
429,429,1802.63,1808.42,7,3,I think so yeah fifty thirty isn't this a hundred,1,0
430,430,1809.92,1811.09,7,3,Like twenty thirty and fifty,0,0
431,431,1812.41,1815.21,7,3,So either a hundred or sixty no,0,0
432,432,1815.97,1817.72,7,1,I think we need to add sixty,0,0
433,433,1817.17,1819.46,7,2,Sixty or eighty I don'­t know,1,0
434,434,1819.97,1822.68,7,3,This was one block that Shadi tried right,0,0
435,435,1824.0,1824.79,7,2,Do you feel it's the same,0,0
436,436,1824.5,1825.68,7,1,It's eighty,1,0
437,437,1828.6,1835.0,7,3,So fifty plus thirty plus twenty is a hundred yeah and the other block was,0,0
438,438,1835.1,1838.47,7,2,So either a hundred or sixty but that's too steep a jump,0,0
439,439,1840.96,1843.68,7,1,I think we should go with ninety and eighty ,0,0
440,440,1841.43,1851.75,7,3,We could try first eighty eighty first Okay Yeah Should eighty final okay,1,0
441,441,1854.33,1855.59,7,3,Um oh eighty,0,0
442,442,1862.43,1864.18,7,3,Yup and then let's,0,0
443,443,1865.33,1875.5,7,3,Okay uh ten ten twenty thirty eighty and fifty yup,0,0
444,444,1877.5,1883.25,7,4,For the final part of this task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the second mystery block,0,0
445,445,1883.75,1888.0,7,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey,0,0
446,446,1889.97,1891.92,7,2,Which is the missing second block,0,0
447,447,1910.87,1912.67,7,1,It should be something like,0,0
448,448,1913.67,1915.09,7,2,The second mystery block,0,0
449,449,1915.67,1923.42,7,3,Does this not seem like the Fibonacci sequence like one one two three five eight and then one thirty,0,0
450,450,1924.25,1924.5,7,1,Yeah,0,0
451,451,1928.33,1928.58,7,3,Yeah,0,0
452,452,1930.09,1937.84,7,2,One one two three five yeah yeah,0,0
453,453,1936.33,1940.67,7,3,Five plus three eight Which is,1,0
454,454,1938.17,1940.92,7,2,So that should be eight plus five so thirteen,1,0
455,455,1943.42,1944.17,7,1,Are we sure,0,0
456,456,1944.92,1950.18,7,3,I like Yeah like it seems the obvious pattern,0,0
457,457,1955.25,1955.5,7,3,Okay,0,0
458,458,1958.09,1959.09,7,1,We can't have,0,0
459,459,1960.84,1970.84,7,1,Actually we can't have forty because we have this one we can't have sixty we have this seventy we have these two eighty,0,0
460,460,1971.78,1974.09,7,1,But we can't oh yeah it's it's Fibonacci,0,0
461,461,1978.0,1978.75,7,3,Yeah like if,0,0
462,462,1980.09,1983.85,7,3,I think so Okay um,0,1
463,463,1980.59,1981.85,7,2,Yeah one thirty,0,0
464,464,1990.59,1992.09,7,3,If anybody else wants to type,0,0
465,465,2015.32,2015.58,7,3,Yeah,0,0
466,466,2019.89,2023.84,7,1,Maybe we should guess the weight of that with Fibonacci as well,0,0
467,467,2025.0,2026.5,7,2,Yeah that was one thirty so it'll be,0,0
468,468,2026.47,2029.47,7,1,No I mean this one based on the other,1,0
469,469,2027.5,2033.5,7,3,This one yeah so one one two three five and then three plus five is eight,1,0
470,470,2033.52,2033.85,7,1,Yeah,0,0
471,471,2034.31,2034.47,7,3,Yeah ,0,0
472,472,2050.5,2051.25,7,3,I think so,0,0
473,473,2052.08,2057.25,7,2,We placed the in the correct position so it was easy to see that they fit into the Fibonacci series,0,0
474,474,2057.42,2060.24,7,3,Yeah I think that is fine,0,0
475,475,2063.17,2063.21,7,3,Yeah,0,0
476,476,2064.17,2064.67,7,1,Hey,0,0
477,477,2070.42,2071.0,7,1,Are we done,0,0
