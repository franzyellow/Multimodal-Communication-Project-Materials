0,0,2.43,5.7,9,4,Gonna callibrate my cameras,0,0
1,1,12.39,16.2,9,4,Ok the task you are completing today is called the weights task,0,0
2,2,16.74,21.03,9,4,In the first part you guys are going to work together to determine the weights of these cubes,0,0
3,3,22.14,24.27,9,4,The red cube is ten grams,0,0
4,4,24.69,28.35,9,4,You are going to determinet the weights of the remaining cubes using this scale,0,0
5,5,29.1,33.12,9,4,Uh the weights are all in intervals of ten so you don't need to use the slider at all,0,0
6,6,33.39,36.42,9,4,All of the weights er ah sorry the scale is not perfect,0,0
7,7,36.66,41.1,9,4,So as long as it doesn't drop to one side the swaying is probably even,0,0
8,8,42.57,46.89,9,4,And if you can place the cubes on the worksheet as you go as well as fill out the survey,0,0
9,9,47.46,52.77,9,4,Alright here you guys are going to be group nine and you can go ahead and get started,0,0
10,10,54.15,57.66,9,3,Let's go,0,0
11,11,61.74,63.4,9,2,I would say that's equal probably,0,0
12,12,63.51,65.73,9,3,Looks equal yeah get,0,0
13,13,77.08,77.75,9,1, I would say that's equal,0,0
14,14,77.85,79.58,9,3,Yeah it should be same I guess,0,1
15,15,78.25,79.01,9,2,Yeah that 's good,0,0
16,16,79.83,82.33,9,1,Yeah ok so that one will go,0,0
17,17,91.05,93.03,9,3,I think it's the,0,0
18,18,96.66,97.83,9,2,Yeah it's probably equal,0,0
19,19,103.33,105.99,9,1,So we got ten ten,0,0
20,20,107.83,108.58,9,3,That's not,0,0
21,21,108.23,111.27,9,1,Definitely not equal,1,0
22,22,121.26,122.25,9,2,Ok  ,0,0
23,23,123.02,123.5,9,1,Sweet,0,0
24,24,130.26,133.35,9,1,That was twenty and ten right ok,0,1
25,25,131.58,132.83,9,3,That was twenty ten yep,0,0
26,26,133.38,135.67,9,1,Look we have the thirty gram block and then,0,0
27,27,135.33,136.77,9,3,I think yep,1,0
28,28,137.46,140.04,9,1,And then we can do,0,0
29,29,140.7,146.1,9,1,The two the yellow and green I don't know just kidding,0,0
30,30,160.22,164.84,9,2,Just like ever so slightly though so it's probably probably say that's equal,0,1
31,31,161.92,164.17,9,1,Oh yeah ok oh never mind ok ,0,0
32,32,159.72,167.91,9,3,I think it's sixty so this one was twenty,0,0
33,33,168.42,170.83,9,3,This one was thirty so this should be fifty less,0,0
34,34,171.75,173.75,9,1,Ok good deal,0,0
35,35,174.81,176.91,9,3,And then  ,0,0
36,36,186.51,188.61,9,3,Yellow is,0,0
37,37,203.76,205.74,9,3,Can I do it,0,0
38,38,205.8,206.85,9,2,Yeah think so,0,0
39,39,206.97,207.99,9,1,Yeah yeah looks right,0,0
40,40,210.81,215.88,9,3,So it is ten yellow is fifty that's right green is twenty,0,0
41,41,216.03,222.27,9,3,Yeah we are right which one is mystery block,0,0
42,42,228.38,232.56,9,4,Ok now you will determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale,0,0
43,43,226.17,227.15,9,1,Ah,0,0
44,44,232.59,238.62,9,4,You will have you will have two attempts to uh enter the weight correctly and you can now begin,0,0
45,45,232.59,233.83,9,3,Without using scale,0,0
46,46,243.39,247.29,9,3,Interesting it's heavier than that one so,0,0
47,47,251.64,254.22,9,3,It's heavier than this too as well,0,0
48,48,265.44,265.99,9,3,Maybe,0,0
49,49,266.42,266.67,9,1,Maybe,0,0
50,50,266.92,267.95,9,2,I don't know if I trust you,0,0
51,51,272.49,276.51,9,3,Maybe it will right I'm not sure,0,0
52,52,279.15,281.37,9,2,Honestly this one feels heavier still,0,1
53,53,280.15,280.83,9,3,Yeah,0,0
54,54,281.67,292.59,9,3,I feel like I'm going to do a comparison between like how heavy this one feels compared to was this the this was our heaviest right before oh the yellow one's heaviest compared and then compared to,0,0
55,55,288.33,290.17,9,3,No the yellow one is the heaviest,0,0
56,56,298.56,306.24,9,1,Yeah I feel like oh we got all the way up to like one forty ok just kidding I thought it was just up to seventy I was like we'll just go with our maximum,0,0
57,57,308.76,314.07,9,3,Yeah so I guess it's fifty plus thirty eighty then forty,0,0
58,58,314.34,318.24,9,3,One twenty it's higher than one twenty at least so maybe,0,0
59,59,318.3,318.92,9,3,I don't know this,0,0
60,60,319.65,321.04,9,2,I'd say it's probably at least one forty,0,0
61,61,321.01,321.99,9,1,So one forty,1,0
62,62,327.15,329.79,9,3,It can't be one fifty or we'll have the option of one fifty,0,0
63,63,322.86,326.03,9,1,The red on the bottom for us,0,0
64,64,333.63,336.51,9,2,I don't think it's one thirty,0,0
65,65,336.99,340.35,9,3,Ok so it's either one forty and one fifty ok,0,1
66,66,337.92,339.42,9,2,I feel like yeah,0,0
67,67,340.71,342.63,9,3,Let's go with first start with one forty,0,0
68,68,341.82,345.51,9,1,Let's do one forty we'll split the difference but not really,1,0
69,69,352.22,355.14,9,3,So we were wrong I guess then one fifty,0,0
70,70,351.42,251.11,9,1,I'd go with one fifty then,0,0
71,71,355.56,357.54,9,2,That's what I would say,0,0
72,72,368.01,374.61,9,4,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block,0,0
73,73,360.33,365.91,9,3,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's ,0,0
74,74,361.17,367.17,9,1,Eighty that's not right it's,1,0
75,75,374.88,379.04,9,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey,0,0
76,76,389.08,384.87,9,3,Um it's saying unable to connect our servers please shut internet servers and try again,0,0
77,77,387.69,389.92,9,2,Like no shot this is eighty grams,0,0
78,78,392.42,393.3,9,1,Abosolutely no way,0,0
79,79,394.26,396.17,9,2,Unless they lied like,0,0
80,80,396.02,400.53,9,3,Yeah ok there's a mystery block two,1,1
81,81,397.5,398.91,9,1,Maybe,0,0
82,82,417.72,420.63,9,1,So we have a second mystery block that we don't know the weight of,0,0
83,83,420.75,421.05,9,3,Yeah,0,0
84,84,421.25,422.73,9,1,Could we just,0,0
85,85,423.15,425.5,9,1,Haven't we don't even have at all ok,0,0
86,86,424.5,427.38,9,3,Yeah we just have to guess,1,0
87,87,430.65,432.66,9,2,So we we have two tens,0,0
88,88,433.11,441.39,9,3,Yeah that was fifty um was twenty and this one was thirty,0,1
89,89,433.33,434.01,9,2,Two tens,0,0
90,90,434.08,436.58,9,1,What was this like was that fifty,0,0
91,91,441.48,444.24,9,3,This one was two eighty,0,0
92,92,454.41,459.18,9,2,I mean if you like sum these two you get that one and if you sum these two you get this one,0,1
93,93,456.83,458.08,9,3,Yeah um,0,0
94,94,459.42,462.78,9,2,Sum these two you get that one so this one should be eighty,0,1
95,95,460.38,461.92,9,3,So it's kind of fibonacci series,0,0
96,96,464.04,465.52,9,2,And then these two should be one thirty,0,0
97,97,464.04,466.67,9,3,One thirty,0,0
98,98,467.67,469.38,9,1,I would say that's sound logic,0,0
99,99,476.16,481.17,9,3,What do you want me to write,0,0
100,100,481.59,482.92,9,2,Um that's fibonacci series right,0,0
101,101,482.83,486.51,9,1,Yeah fibonacci sure yeah seems like fib,1,0
102,102,487.33,484.42,9,1,Unless it's not,0,0
103,103,492.66,495.17,9,2,Some mathmatical thing,0,0
104,104,493.92,497.7,9,1,Some sort of counting upwards by combining them,1,0
105,105,500.46,502.89,9,3,Call it swerve yeah,0,0
106,106,502.92,506.76,9,3,Fibonacci,0,0
107,107,506.79,509.76,9,2,I think there's two c's in there,0,0
108,108,513.33,515.31,9,2,I I really don't know actually,0,0
109,109,515.43,518.52,9,3,Me neither looks right are you alright,0,0
110,110,515.92,520.95,9,1,Looks kind of right yeah I like it,1,0
111,111,523.02,523.75,9,3,Yeah you alright,0,0
112,112,524.17,526.98,9,2,Yes yes,0,1
113,113,524.56,524.85,9,1,Yes  ,0,0
