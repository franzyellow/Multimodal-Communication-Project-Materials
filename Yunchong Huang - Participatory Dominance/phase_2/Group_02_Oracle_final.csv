0,0,2.88,5.91,2,4,Callibrate my cameras real quick,0,0
1,1,14.82,18.18,2,4,So the task you are completing today is called the weights task,0,0
2,2,18.75,23.1,2,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weight of these five cubes,0,0
3,3,23.52,32.73,2,4,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams yep and you're going you're going to flip the piece of paper um,0,0
4,4,27.15,28.38,2,2,Can we use this piece of paper,0,0
5,5,33.3,36.42,2,4,You are going to determine the rest of the weights using them,0,0
6,6,36.45,38.76,2,4,Using the scale um,0,0
7,7,39.48,45.21,2,4,And you don't need to use the slider on the scale just like round up to whatever like zero so you don't have to worry about like 23,0,0
8,8,46.83,54.78,2,4,Um and then go ahead and place the scale on the worksheet when you've gotten the weight and also enter it into this survey,0,0
9,9,54.9,57.3,2,4,You guys are going to be group two,0,0
10,10,57.63,58.83,2,4,And you can go ahead and start,0,0
11,11,59.58,65.92,2,2,Alright you guys mind if I just start some tests,0,0
12,12,60.84,68.01,3,1,Ok cool no for sure,1,0
13,13,81.33,85.53,2,1,Yeah it's like a bit slow to level up,0,0
14,14,86.82,88.95,2,1,So I would imagine if this,0,0
15,15,88.98,91.58,2,1,Needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal,0,0
16,16,92.58,94.65,2,2,And I I think they are,0,0
17,17,94.77,97.05,2,2,Especially since it keeps going back in a,0,0
18,18,97.11,102.39,2,1,Yeah they also just look like relatively the same size but they could be different material you know,0,1
19,19,97.37,98.25,2,2,Even length,0,0
20,20,104.08,106.23,2,1,So that one is probably ten grams too,0,0
21,21,102.45,104.75,2,2,Yeah,0,0
22,22,108.06,111.3,2,1,And then if that's ten grams then we have a two,0,0
23,23,112.29,117.87,2,2,So I'm going to hold back on that one because I think it's the heaviest,0,1
24,24,115.73,116.17,2,1,Yeah,0,0
25,25,119.13,120.16,2,1,We can do like the,0,0
26,26,120.5,121.59,2,2,The green one,0,0
27,27,121.74,123.9,2,2,By touch feels lighter,0,0
28,28,124.68,127.02,2,2,And that looks like it might be about even,0,0
29,29,133.83,136.17,2,1,Ok,0,0
30,30,138.0,140.31,2,1,There we go that's better,0,0
31,31,141.27,146.91,2,2,Well on the first go through I noticed how it bounced twice and actually get some momentum ok so then,0,0
32,32,144.92,149.08,2,1,Yeah so that's probably twenty grams,1,0
33,33,149.97,151.95,2,1,You'd imagine and then,0,0
34,34,152.31,153.75,2,1,The first two are ten,0,0
35,35,154.58,155.34,2,2,Yep,0,0
36,36,155.49,158.1,2,2,Um,0,0
37,37,158.13,164.17,2,2,So knowing that uh oh sorry the green one was yeah,0,0
38,38,164.31,165.67,2,1,Twenty probably,0,0
39,39,165.56,166.59,2,3,Yeah,0,0
40,40,167.13,169.11,2,3,This is what we are looking at next,0,0
41,41,169.26,171.42,2,2,Yeah,0,0
42,42,192.69,195.87,2,1,So you know twenty plus ten thirty probably,0,0
43,43,195.93,199.5,2,2,Yeah but it still feels like it's leaning towards the two blocks,0,0
44,44,199.75,200.82,2,1,Oh yeah it does,0,0
45,45,216.87,220.01,2,1,I guess it's leveling out a bit more but,0,0
46,46,220.25,221.25,2,2,Yeah,0,0
47,47,221.4,225.41,2,2,I guess and there's no increment so five so we could probably just go with thirty on that,0,0
48,48,222.5,227.46,2,1,Yeah yeah closest like,1,0
49,49,227.7,230.91,2,1,Accuracy wise so then you know,0,0
50,50,231.42,233.46,2,1,You can do the same process with,0,0
51,51,233.61,236.49,2,1,Putting this on that side checking this one,0,0
52,52,237.51,241.77,2,1,Which is too much so we'll put twenty right,0,0
53,53,247.95,250.17,2,2,So that's the twenty and the thirty,0,0
54,54,255.36,258.01,2,2,It's leaning towards one side a bit much,0,0
55,55,258.08,260.67,2,1,Yeah we could probably try it with just ten,0,0
56,56,264.3,268.65,2,1,Oh not enough so probably,0,1
57,57,266.91,267.33,2,2,Ok,0,0
58,58,269.61,271.59,2,1,Twenty then,0,0
59,59,271.92,275.16,2,2,Oh yeah the twenty and the thirty so we'll go with the fifty,0,1
60,60,272.5,274.25,2,1,Yeah and the thirty so fifty,0,0
61,61,285.15,287.16,2,2,Alright,0,0
62,62,288.12,290.1,2,1,Wait did we mix these up or ,0,0
63,63,290.16,291.07,2,2,No,0,0
64,64,293.66,294.75,2,3,So these are both ten,0,0
65,65,291.91,296.1,2,1,I got no good ok,0,0
66,66,297.06,297.75,2,3,Blue or purple,0,0
67,67,298.74,299.64,2,1,Um,0,0
68,68,300.51,302.82,2,1,I think purple or,0,0
69,69,303.75,309.48,2,2,This would be blue this would be purple yeah I thought they were both blue until,0,0
70,70,303.15,307.25,2,1,Blue yeah no I see that's like a navy blue,0,0
71,71,309.87,311.85,2,2,Question was asked,0,0
72,72,332.49,334.47,2,3,Are we supposed to write on the worksheet,0,0
73,73,335.41,338.13,2,4,If you guys have gotten to the end of that we can,0,0
74,74,334.86,335.33,2,2,Um,0,0
75,75,339.06,340.5,2,2,Ok yep,0,1
76,76,338.52,338.91,2,4,Over,0,0
77,77,339.16,339.42,2,3,Ok,0,0
78,78,343.98,346.75,2,2,Wait a mystery block,0,0
79,79,347.25,348.63,2,4,So,0,0
80,80,351.21,353.19,2,2,Without the scale,0,0
81,81,353.28,357.36,2,4,For the next part of your task you will determine the weight of this mystery block,0,0
82,82,358.26,361.53,2,4,Scale you will have two attempts to enter the weight correctly,0,0
83,83,358.34,358.74,2,2,Ok,0,0
84,84,362.16,363.08,2,4,You can now continue the survey,0,0
85,85,362.16,368.79,2,2,Alright uh we are allowed to use the other blocks in holding the weight,0,0
86,86,381.48,384.42,2,2,Ok so this block is heavier than our fifty,0,0
87,87,384.57,387.39,2,1,Oh yeah much much more,0,0
88,88,419.43,421.68,2,1,Yeah I mean that seems pretty similar,0,0
89,89,429.78,430.58,2,1,That also seems similar,0,0
90,90,432.08,433.47,2,2,Do you want to give it a shot,0,0
91,91,443.04,445.71,2,3,Like all of these,0,0
92,92,456.42,458.4,2,2,All of these together is going to be,0,0
93,93,458.5,458.66,2,2,Fifty  ,0,0
94,94,468.03,468.42,2,2,Twenty  ,0,0
95,95,468.66,470.55,2,1,Yeah cause that's,0,0
96,96,470.94,473.52,2,1,Forty plus thirty seventy,0,0
97,97,473.58,475.65,2,1,And fifty right,0,0
98,98,477.27,478.57,2,1,So yeah  ,0,0
99,99,478.01,480.78,2,2,Yeah we got the two tens,1,0
100,100,481.35,483.66,2,2,Twenty,0,0
101,101,484.65,486.63,2,2,Thirty and then fifty,0,0
102,102,490.2,492.18,2,1,So it's probably,0,0
103,103,492.42,494.97,2,2,I might shoot all the way for the one forty,0,1
104,104,492.66,493.42,2,1,Yeah,0,0
105,105,495.0,498.57,2,1,I think it's a bit more than the max,0,0
106,106,498.84,502.35,2,1,So yeah probably maybe one forty plus or minus ten,0,0
107,107,502.65,504.63,2,2,Ok is the,0,0
108,108,502.92,504.58,2,2,Actually either one thirty,0,0
109,109,504.87,507.72,2,2,Is the can the weight exceed what's on the paper,0,0
110,110,513.15,518.4,2,1,No ok maybe we should do one thirty and then,0,0
111,111,513.15,515.18,2,4,No,0,0
112,112,518.88,521.67,2,1,Or one forty and then one thirty if we think,0,0
113,113,522.0,530.37,2,1,I don't know that's kind of my thought process um,0,1
114,114,524.42,530.37,2,2,I was thinking one forty first as well but um,0,1
115,115,527.5,528.95,2,3,Is it one fifty on here,0,0
116,116,536.82,543.24,2,2,Honestly I still feel like we should go with one forty first and if not we should actually move to one thirty,0,0
117,117,543.33,546.12,2,2,Sorry one fifty since it's on there,0,0
118,118,548.13,548.52,2,3,One forty,0,0
119,119,549.5,550.0,2,1,Yeah,0,0
120,120,549.75,550.71,2,2,Yeah,0,0
121,121,555.15,557.19,2,1,Is it wrong,0,0
122,122,557.43,560.52,2,2,Not quite correct,0,0
123,123,561.12,563.42,2,2,One more attempt alright,0,0
124,124,524.42,566.28,2,1,So plus or minus ten right,0,0
125,125,567.03,569.85,2,1,So we can try and,0,0
126,126,580.53,583.02,2,1,I don't know it's probably better if the same hand,0,0
127,127,583.92,585.9,2,2,Yeah,0,0
128,128,592.16,597.32,2,2,I'm feeling the one fifty personally but,0,0
129,129,590.79,591.33,2,1,I don't know I mean,0,0
130,130,595.0,597.51,2,3,Wait what it it again when it's lined up,1,0
131,131,598.75,602.55,2,2,That's a ten ten that's a twenty,0,0
132,132,597.9,599.5,2,1,Um think yeah these are ten,0,0
133,133,602.91,604.98,2,2,Fifty and that's a thirty,0,0
134,134,607.98,612.63,2,2,And we guessed this was a one forty so our options were one thirty or,0,0
135,135,612.75,614.73,2,2,Off the paper,0,0
136,136,616.02,618.0,2,2,Together that's one twenty,0,0
137,137,623.01,624.9,2,3,I think it has to do with patterns,0,0
138,138,619.95,623.34,2,2,Um personally ,0,0
139,139,625.26,629.07,2,3,Because it says think about the relationship between the weights of the power blocks,0,0
140,140,629.67,632.49,2,3,And if you do like,0,0
141,141,629.58,630.03,2,2,Oh yeah,0,0
142,142,637.71,639.99,2,3,These add up to twenty,0,0
143,143,640.29,642.9,2,3,These add up to thirty these add up to fifty,0,0
144,144,644.79,647.37,2,3,But that doesn't really make sense either I don't know,0,0
145,145,647.49,649.47,2,1,Yeah I mean this could be,0,0
146,146,649.98,655.71,2,1,This set of two adds up to this one and then the next set of two adds up to that,0,0
147,147,655.86,661.77,2,2,So these would add up to eighty and then eighty plus fifty would be one thirty,0,1
148,148,656.5,658.58,2,3,So it would be eighty and you weigh less,0,0
149,149,664.32,666.3,2,3,And thirty ,0,0
150,150,673.68,676.8,2,3,I think it's just the last two so it would just be fifty and thirty,0,0
151,151,677.25,680.28,2,3,I think it just feels like it's,0,0
152,152,680.52,684.83,2,3,A lot heavier because it's denser and like just carrying that,0,1
153,153,682.33,683.66,2,1,Yeah that might makes sense,0,0
154,154,684.83,686.01,2,2,Were we right then,0,0
155,155,686.58,689.04,2,3,No you're wrong it was eighty,0,0
156,156,689.13,690.47,2,3,Cause I think we did one step too much,0,1
157,157,689.58,671.17,2,1,Yeah it's a pattern,0,0
158,158,691.9,692.04,2,2,Really,0,0
159,159,694.74,696.72,2,4,Have you guys finished the second one,0,0
160,160,697.05,698.25,2,1,Um yeah we just finished,0,0
161,161,697.5,700.29,2,3,Is is the yeah mystery block,1,0
162,162,708.83,715.11,2,4,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the,0,0
163,163,715.23,719.25,2,4,Second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer,0,0
164,164,726.81,730.89,2,3,Well that was our one thirty right because that was fifty,0,0
165,165,731.43,733.44,2,1,Yeah so,0,0
166,166,733.56,737.28,2,1,That makes sense yeah fifty and eighty one thirty,0,0
167,167,741.39,747.66,2,1,And then like every set of two I guess and the next block will be the set,0,0
168,168,747.78,753.15,2,1,The like sum of the two previous blocks,0,0
169,169,760.68,763.32,2,3,In order to like,0,0
170,170,763.77,765.75,2,3,Least heavy to most heavy or,0,0
171,171,765.96,772.68,2,1,I guess heaviest to least heaviest maybe because these two add up to that one,0,0
172,172,772.95,775.05,2,1,These two add up to that one,0,0
173,173,775.65,781.08,2,1,These two I guess it doesn't matter which order it's just the sum of the previous two,0,1
174,174,777.95,778.5,2,3,Yeah,0,0
175,175,777.83,778.5,2,1,Yeah,0,0
176,176,783.27,785.49,2,1,And yeah I guess in order of,0,1
177,177,784.33,784.84,2,2,Um,0,0
178,178,785.42,786.66,2,1,Wait yeah,0,0
179,179,801.27,801.92,2,3,Ok we're done,0,0
180,180,801.75,803.25,2,1,Alright cool,1,0
