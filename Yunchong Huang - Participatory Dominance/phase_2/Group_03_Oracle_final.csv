1,1,28.2,32.67,3,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of these blocks,0,0
2,2,33.39,38.04,3,4,We will tell you that the weight of the red cube is ten grams,0,0
3,3,38.76,42.57,3,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using this scale,0,0
4,4,43.68,46.5,3,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams,0,0
5,5,46.86,50.43,3,4,You don't need to use the slider or anything ,0,0
6,6,51.0,58.38,3,4,And the the weights aren't always perfect so like if it's teetering it's probably fine,0,0
7,7,58.44,60.57,3,4,Like it it drops one's probably heavier,0,0
8,8,61.35,64.23,3,4,Um and then,0,0
9,9,64.26,75.69,3,4,You will place the cubes on the worksheet where you think they are and you will also record your answers here on this survey here on the computer. You guys will be group three,0,0

199,199,1054.65,1064.31,3,1,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right,0,1
200,200,1054.83,1059.92,3,3,It's the same ok,0,0
201,201,1064.4,1066.56,3,3,Is it ok,0,0
202,202,1071.57,1080.81,3,1,It's I think I think this one's this block is just too flat,0,1
203,203,1076.25,1079.75,3,3,Yeah it's maybe let's try it with the smaller one then,0,0
204,204,1083.99,1086.33,3,1,Just to test like,0,0
205,205,1086.75,1089.72,3,1,Yeah I think it's,0,0
206,206,1090.32,1095.54,3,1,They're just too sturdy and flat it's like hard to tell,0,0
207,207,1095.84,1098.9,3,1,We can definitely rule things out but I think uh,0,0
208,208,1099.74,1102.17,3,1,Too crude of a measurement to to,0,0
209,209,1102.44,1105.44,3,1,Narrow down that like ten gram window,0,0
210,210,1110.48,1113.69,3,1,Do we want to say eighty,0,0
211,211,1113.78,1117.35,3,3,I'm confused between eighty and ninety,0,0
212,212,1133.08,1135.47,3,1,Yeah it's too balanced,0,0
213,213,1136.01,1140.99,3,1,Like have another object,0,0
214,214,1144.16,1145.64,3,3,Uh there's a scale,0,0
215,215,1142.61,1143.83,3,1,Are we allowed to use,0,0
216,216,1146.0,1161.36,3,1,Well we're not even allowed to use the scale I say we give it our best guess at this point um,0,1
217,217,1155.66,1158.34,3,3,So what should I answer this ,0,0
218,218,1173.27,1175.64,3,3,We have two attempts to do this,0,0
219,219,1175.85,1185.58,3,1,Ok we have two attempts oh well then let's maybe we just try eighty and see if that's right and if it's not then it rules out,0,0
220,220,1175.85,1188.87,3,3,Yeah we have two attempts eighty eighty is good for three ninety yeah I'm just clicking on eighty,0,0
221,221,1191.3,1198.41,3,3,Oh it's right eighty yes,0,0
222,222,1191.3,1198.41,3,1,Oh we got it it's right eighty yeah,0,0
223,223,1198.5,1201.29,3,4,Ok for the final part of the task,0,0
224,224,1201.44,1206.6,3,4,Read the scenario in the next slide and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block,0,0
225,225,1206.99,1210.83,3,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey,0,0
226,226,1211.83,1215.83,3,3,Uh the factory that creates wooden blocks did not send us a second mystery block,0,0
227,227,1218.33,1220.31,3,3,Weights so the second block,0,0
228,228,1224.81,1223.58,3,1,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right,0,0
229,229,1227.5,1236.0,3,3,The second yes yeah so we have to use only this,0,0
230,230,1237.44,1244.92,3,1,Well I assume we can use the second the first mystery block as a data point,0,0
231,231,1240.92,1247.04,3,3,The first mystery block this is eighty we could just ,1,0
232,232,1247.22,1247.91,3,1,Yeah,0,0
233,233,1248.75,1250.88,3,2,Uh I how,0,0
234,234,1251.12,1254.33,3,2,Like they have two one forty grams,0,0
235,235,1254.51,1268.76,3,2,So it must be a set so we should be able to make every possible weight here with these blocks they have one fifty two,0,1
236,236,1262.75,1266.66,3,1,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got ,0,0
237,237,1268.82,1271.1,3,2,Maybe,0,0
238,238,1272.27,1275.92,3,2,Maybe we must be able to do every weight here,0,0
239,239,1276.5,1282.02,3,3,Yeah the highest we can make is a one fifty we can make a one fifty even,0,0
240,240,1282.86,1288.58,3,2,And we can make it up to one fifty so if we find a block which can make,0,0
241,241,1288.41,1291.65,3,1,So with all of these we can make it up to one fifty,1,0
242,242,1293.03,1298.01,3,1,Ok yeah eighty plus fifty fifty and then yeah ok,0,0
243,243,1298.55,1308.63,3,2,We have ten two tens we have twenty we have thirty we can make forty with these three we can we have fifty,0,0
244,244,1309.08,1312.83,3,2,We have fifty with sixty sixty these two seventy,0,0
245,245,1312.83,1314.06,3,3,Sixty and these two,0,0
246,246,1314.21,1318.58,3,2,We have eighty we can make ninety we can make,0,0
247,247,1315.92,1322.07,3,3,We can make ninety a hundred even one ten even,1,0
248,248,1322.73,1325.94,3,2,One ten ok one twenty,0,0
249,249,1326.75,1330.42,3,3,Yeah we can it's thirty and ten,0,0
250,250,1329.15,1334.28,3,2,Yeah this is four ok one twenty is done ,1,0
251,251,1335.92,1340.33,3,3,One thirty is automatically fifty plus eighty,0,0
252,252,1334.55,1341.96,3,2,And uh one thirty yeah fifty ok,0,0
253,253,1343.08,1348.38,3,3,One forty obviously we can make that and one fifty,0,0
254,254,1342.17,1346.66,3,2,And then ok ,0,0
255,255,1350.501,1353.42,3,1,So we want to guess one fifty is that,0,0
256,256,1348.5,1350.58,3,3,And yeah we can make everything,0,0
257,257,1358.22,1363.05,3,3,We have two oppurtunities for that even so,0,0
258,258,1363.11,1374.9,3,3,Whatever like how did we guess eighty like we used only two blocks even for measurement of everything we just used two blocks so I'm thinking,0,0
259,259,1375.02,1377.81,3,3,If we just used only two blocks then,0,0
260,260,1377.93,1380.87,3,3,The highest two blocks may weigh something,0,0
261,261,1381.35,1388.85,3,3,One thirty yeah because we measured this with the help of,0,0
262,262,1381.33,1384.25,3,1,And that would be one thirty right ,0,0
263,263,1388.94,1390.92,3,3,These two,0,0
264,264,1392.09,1397.94,3,3,And with this we measured with these two and with this we measured with the help of these two,0,0
265,265,1394.33,1397.94,3,1,Wait wait wait,0,0
266,266,1399.11,1399.84,3,3,We almost,0,0

271,271,1409.97,1414.62,3,2,Yes it's a Fibonnaci series,0,0
272,272,1414.68,1417.5,3,2,One one twenty then,0,0
273,273,1417.77,1423.01,3,2,Thirty thirty plus twenty fifty fifty plus thirty eighty eighty plus fifty one thirty,0,0
274,274,1418.91,1424.37,3,3,Thirty fifty eight one thirty,1,0
275,275,1424.73,1429.26,3,3,Ok let me try one thirty,0,0
276,276,1429.62,1431.9,3,3,And,0,0
277,277,1433.22,1435.08,3,3,Oh what should I index,0,0
278,278,1435.58,1436.33,3,2,The fibonacci series,0,0
279,279,1454.75,1458.72,3,3,Sounds good ok I'm submitting this,0,0
280,280,1464.63,1465.5,3,1,It means we're awesome,0,0
