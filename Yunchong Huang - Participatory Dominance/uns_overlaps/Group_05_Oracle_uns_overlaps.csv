1,145,558.63,560.84,5,2,So we can you think one ten,Competitive
0,151,579.96,595.95,5,3,So it was ten ten twenty um so the hint is think about the relationship between the weights of the prior blocks and use that pattern to determine the weight of the mystery block it was ten ten twenty thirty fifty,Passive
1,152,580.02,583.5,5,1,It was not quite correct no alright alright,Competitive
0,153,598.89,613.17,5,3,This is so no no it gets this plus this equals this this plus this equals this this plus this is or this plus this yeah so we're thinking eighty,Passive
1,155,608.67,613.02,5,2,So this plus this equals this ,Competitive
0,157,616.73,630.58,5,2,I mean we can we can I guess we could feel it ok you know what this does feel pretty close I think maybe the distrubtuion just messed us up,Passive

0,175,718.35,729.51,5,3,You have two oppurtunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one to two sentences how you determined your estimate indicate the weight of the second mystery block yep,Passive
1,176,726.64,728.76,5,1,If we decide to continue on the pattern,Competitive
0,179,736.53,750.69,5,1,The summation of the previous two which actually makes sense because this ten plus 0 is ten ten plus ten is twenty well yeah but yeah,Passive
1,180,745.75,747.75,5,2,So we're thinking it's like the Fibonacci series then  ,Competitive
0,179,736.53,750.69,5,1,The summation of the previous two which actually makes sense because this ten plus 0 is ten ten plus ten is twenty well yeah but yeah,Passive
1,181,737.93,749.78,5,3,Of the previous two oh sure yeah pretty much it's the same idea,Competitive
