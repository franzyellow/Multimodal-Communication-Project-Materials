1,19,97.37,98.25,2,2,Even length,Competitive
0,23,112.29,117.87,2,2,So I'm going to hold back on that one because I think it's the heaviest,Passive

0,152,680.52,684.83,2,3,A lot heavier because it's denser and like just carrying that,Passive
1,153,682.33,683.66,2,1,Yeah that might makes sense,Supportive
