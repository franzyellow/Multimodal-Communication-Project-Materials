22,22,82.97,87.91,10,3,I mean what why didn't we first check out whether these two are equal They are of equal size but
24,24,87.41,90.17,10,2,They're the same Uhhhh just don't want to touch it
26,26,100.0,101.08,10,2,Yeah I suppose
27,27,100.84,102.85,10,3,Right so then that's twenty these two are ten
28,28,104.33,105.32,10,2,Let's see
29,29,104.59,106.59,10,1,That would make sense to me
47,47,157.81,163.33,10,1,I'm not sure was uh just a bit more like we would be able to tell the difference
48,48,161.42,163.39,10,2,Just a second just a sec
49,49,166.41,167.67,10,3,Like you would be able to see it right?
50,50,167.39,170.0,10,2,Yeah yeah yeah yeah Just a sec
54,54,203.33,216.41,10,2,We we moved it and checked the two tens remember we didn't do this one Okay yeah sure sure sure yeah yeah put thirty Thirty yeah
55,55,207.46,217.0,10,3,Yeah but then when we have the two yeah Yeah yeah so I would say around thirty two or something
57,57,217.89,219.78,10,2,Thirty one thirty two so thirty
58,58,218.23,220.5,10,3,So okay Cool
59,59,223.0,225.0,10,1,Um you know what let's try this
60,60,224.72,225.48,10,3,What's left
64,64,250.73,250.83,10,1,Twenty
65,65,250.75,251.5,10,3,Twenty Yeah
67,67,263.83,268.91,10,3,I mean it's not gonna go anywhere I guess it's just Oh
68,68,265.91,269.13,10,2,It's more tilting to the right so less than fifty
72,72,278.32,281.31,10,2,Just a sec let this settle now Yeah
73,73,280.08,283.33,10,3,This is gonna be too heavy I think this is around yeah
88,88,320.47,320.71,10,2,Hopefully
89,89,320.63,322.0,10,3,Well we have more weights here
92,92,327.82,333.09,10,1,What are we supposed to do we are supposed do We are supposed to enter it in the laptop
93,93,329.82,334.59,10,3,Do you have more blocks or I think we're done here Oh okay let's do that
94,94,335.64,336.41,10,2,Ten I guess
95,95,335.87,337.17,10,3,Group number ten
96,96,342.68,349.0,10,3,okay Now help me out Fifty Okay green
97,97,343.5,350.5,10,2,So the yellow one's fifty Yeah Green wait green's twenty
96,96,342.68,349.0,10,3,okay Now help me out Fifty Okay green
98,98,344.52,350.68,10,1,Fifty Yeah Twenty
97,97,343.5,350.5,10,2,So the yellow one's fifty Yeah Green wait green's twenty
98,98,344.52,350.68,10,1,Fifty Yeah Twenty
100,100,353.34,355.84,10,1,And they're two blue
101,101,355.32,359.09,10,2,Tens tens are blue blue and red yup
105,105,373.75,382.59,10,3,No I think this is this is the one which is purple Oh
106,106,374.0,383.09,10,2,No no no no So like they gave the weight of this one they gave the weight of the red one so that's why they didn't include this one they already gave us yeah
111,111,391.12,396.25,10,3,Green is twenty I mean we're we're right right I mean we're exactly right
112,112,394.25,397.0,10,2,Uh yeah let's see
116,116,407.84,417.67,10,3,Indicate the weight of the mystery block Whoa Where is the blue guy
117,117,410.18,418.67,10,1,You have two attempts It's heavier than everything else
123,123,428.82,430.07,10,3,That's that was thirty
124,124,429.34,430.58,10,1,Thirty Twenty
136,136,470.5,474.67,10,3,hundred and ten like a hundred or a hundred and ten that would be my guess
137,137,473.25,475.0,10,2,Suppose I remove the tens ones then
146,146,502.0,505.56,10,1,Umm Do you want to try like one thirty
148,148,505.06,509.53,10,2,Like like wait let's remove these two let's check This one is lighter right on the right side
151,151,519.25,526.25,10,3,I don't know like ninety or maybe a hundred you know it could be is my guess We have a hundred and ten
152,152,523.0,528.0,10,2,How much is it so we have fifty thirty eighty ten hundred hundred and twenty
155,155,536.56,541.42,10,1,Yeah uh maybe not Difficult it is um
156,156,539.14,542.64,10,2,Maybe not Just a sec okay
164,164,562.39,568.75,10,3,Right Oh okay
165,165,563.42,569.37,10,1,I I was thinking maybe a little bit higher instead of lower but that also makes sense because I don't know any better
167,167,575.0,577.25,10,2,This feels same almost try it
168,168,577.0,578.0,10,3,Oh let's try it out
170,170,585.84,586.41,10,2,No no no no
171,171,586.17,587.67,10,3,Hundred and ten so that's like a hundred
172,172,589.42,601.34,10,2,No no no no so the thing is like when you put this it feels almost same because it's just ten gram difference that's why Let let's try it Yeah
173,173,596.5,603.02,10,3,So that that would put it at like a hundred Because that one would be a hundred and ten and this is a hundred ten so that's hundred
173,173,596.5,603.02,10,3,So that that would put it at like a hundred Because that one would be a hundred and ten and this is a hundred ten so that's hundred
174,174,601.75,604.25,10,1,I mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess
177,177,614.67,616.41,10,3,Well If we're going to put a hundred and ten What No that's what I said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first I think we should go with a hundred and ten first Then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right
178,178,615.14,627.57,10,2,No wait wait this is hundred this is hundred this is hundred So means hundred and ten is total this Yeah Okay yeah sure sure sure
189,189,667.63,669.41,10,1,Ah I mean that's
190,190,668.13,677.25,10,2,Ten ten this is what twenty right one plus one two yup two plus one three yup three plus two five oh yeah that's fifty
191,191,677.75,685.81,10,2,and five plus three eight yeah let's go for eighty then That's a pattern that's it
192,192,681.34,692.64,10,3,Like just because of just becasuse that's Fibonacci Because I'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means
194,194,692.91,704.0,10,2,Yeah it's is is there any other series I'm not missing out I mean ten Twenty Thirty Fifty
195,195,693.27,705.56,10,3,Is that the pattern or is that you know just use those weights Right That that is true anyway And also I mean
217,217,781.87,792.67,10,1,Fibonacci like let's say That's the first one according to our translate Thirteen one thirty
218,218,784.03,795.67,10,2,Eight That's the first one So eight plus five Thirteen Yeah there is one thirty Eight plus five
227,227,814.08,816.56,10,1,Makes sense to me as much sense as I can make of it
228,228,816.17,819.15,10,2,Yeah One thirty that's it
237,237,863.21,864.34,10,1,eighty plus fifty is
238,238,864.24,866.17,10,2,Yeah one one one thirty one thirty
237,237,863.21,864.34,10,1,eighty plus fifty is
239,239,864.27,867.67,10,3,Yeah it's one thirty it is I know that hang on a second one thirty
238,238,864.24,866.17,10,2,Yeah one one one thirty one thirty
239,239,864.27,867.67,10,3,Yeah it's one thirty it is I know that hang on a second one thirty
