20,20,107.08,107.34,7,1,Okay
21,21,107.31,109.09,7,2,It seems to be ten
23,23,112.42,114.67,7,2,Is that blue or purple this is blue I guess
24,24,114.41,115.17,7,3,This is blue
46,46,162.17,163.67,7,1,This one or this one
47,47,163.58,164.92,7,2,eh that one is lighter yeah
61,61,226.5,228.62,7,3,Yeah I think fifty seems right
62,62,227.54,229.59,7,2,Fifty and the purple is
66,66,236.42,244.67,7,3,Fifty oh purple is thirty yellow
68,68,243.0,246.17,7,2,Uh it's not exactly aligning should I
69,69,246.75,251.0,7,2,So this seem it's little more yeah so should I put something here
71,71,250.0,252.09,7,1,Do you want to put ten it is
79,79,267.67,270.0,7,2,Yeah but we put both ten so that they cancel out
80,80,269.75,272.25,7,1,Now it's completely now
88,88,300.75,304.0,7,1,It's okay or we should just us scale it with this one
89,89,303.75,307.32,7,3,Yeah how about we try like twenty and then
100,100,347.25,347.5,7,3,Or here
101,101,347.42,350.0,7,2,So now we're adding three grams where
108,108,371.42,372.67,7,2,So uh
109,109,372.58,375.42,7,3,So is it to the right right now like the scale
110,110,378.21,381.52,7,3,Like the center scale is it to the right okay so
111,111,380.0,385.92,7,2,Yeah are we allowed to ask questions
110,110,378.21,381.52,7,3,Like the center scale is it to the right okay so
112,112,381.25,383.56,7,1,But it doesn't have any
115,115,394.0,395.75,7,3,Oh okay so
116,116,394.03,397.25,7,1,Ah yeah because yeah so it's fifty
116,116,394.03,397.25,7,1,Ah yeah because yeah so it's fifty
117,117,396.5,399.0,7,2,So now we've kind of destructed everything
123,123,429.0,432.0,7,3,Otherwise uh like it wasn't balanced with
124,124,431.52,432.33,7,1,It's slightly off
127,127,438.41,441.62,7,3,But like the scale isn't properly aligned as well so
128,128,441.41,444.42,7,2,It could be forty but can we measure forty
129,129,445.5,448.5,7,3,So so green
130,130,445.67,449.42,7,2,So that is thirty plus ten so that is purple
136,136,469.42,476.25,7,3,Yeah I think so so red ten Yeah
137,137,470.13,477.0,7,2,That is correct Yellow is fifty Purple was thirty Blue is ten
155,155,543.0,543.25,7,3,I can start
156,156,543.21,546.0,7,2,Should we turn or something so that we don't biased
160,160,593.42,600.5,7,1,Do you need help Ok you go
161,161,594.91,610.14,7,3,I don't know like could somebody else like try Ok I can yeah I think we have like two attempts to tell it to you yeah
176,176,685.01,687.84,7,2,because you are distributing with three fingers
177,177,687.11,689.92,7,1,What about put it on one finger
183,183,714.94,717.25,7,1,I think they are equal yeah
184,184,716.66,717.42,7,2,Now it's equal
185,185,719.0,722.66,7,2,So this is uh thirty plus purple is
186,186,722.25,723.75,7,3,Uh yellow was fifty
188,188,731.83,740.16,7,2,So this is eighty okay So what do you think How did you hold it
189,189,733.03,741.16,7,3,Yeah I think I thought like even all of these combined were Like this
190,190,741.92,743.75,7,2,Like that like on three fingers
191,191,742.42,744.13,7,3,Yes like yep
194,194,752.75,758.83,7,2,One two three fingers I guess it might matter which fingers we're holding with I don't know
195,195,758.08,760.84,7,3,Yeah like how about you try and
207,207,824.5,829.84,7,1,So how about those two I had Eh these two
208,208,829.05,832.0,7,3,Uh Green was Twenty this is thirty this is fifty
214,214,854.21,854.42,7,3,Yeah
215,215,854.33,856.58,7,1,Or juggling like this
238,238,958.09,977.5,7,1,I forgot the name of that but in the physic when you have eight under um larger area what was that Sorry Uh no no the name of that in the physic Perhaps I can see the
239,239,968.16,981.5,7,3,Uh pressure Uh oh Uh I don'­t think we can we use our phones or
239,239,968.16,981.5,7,3,Uh pressure Uh oh Uh I don'­t think we can we use our phones or
241,241,980.85,984.61,7,1,At least I want to see a word No it's okay
245,245,999.0,1006.09,7,2,So I uh maybe I'll try removing weights and I'll add also weights and then we can try to callibrate
246,246,1004.28,1006.54,7,3,Okay yeah yeah
247,247,1013.71,1015.18,7,2,Just keep trying different things
248,248,1014.45,1017.72,7,3,Yeah now like this is heavier yeah
256,256,1055.79,1057.98,7,2,So it's definitely this much
257,257,1057.33,1062.09,7,3,But it could be this much or like with like
262,262,1087.23,1091.23,7,3,Yeah try to hold it like a bit higher I think like Yeah
263,263,1089.95,1091.73,7,2,Yeah don'­t rest your wrists yeah
269,269,1118.73,1119.82,7,2,Between these two
270,270,1119.42,1122.47,7,1,Yeah because when you put could you put that on
273,273,1128.34,1132.67,7,3,Uh the red one Oh yeah uh no Okay so it's like either all of these or with blue
274,274,1129.68,1135.99,7,1,the blue the blue Now it's they are they feel same
276,276,1140.04,1144.92,7,1,Yeah Do you want to try that I just want to make sure
278,278,1144.46,1147.61,7,2,Is there a better I mean now we are almost sure
279,279,1148.0,1155.31,7,1,We can start with the smaller one we can put on the smaller because it is because it is
280,280,1152.23,1157.11,7,3,Okay yeah okay I don'­t 
280,280,1152.23,1157.11,7,3,Okay yeah okay I don'­t 
281,281,1155.61,1159.24,7,2,We have this can we utilize this paper somehow
287,287,1178.85,1181.37,7,1,You should take it like this
288,288,1179.89,1181.61,7,3,Yeah hold it like this yeah
313,313,1289.18,1299.25,7,3,Yeah so Uh yeah how about you add it first and then I'll pick it up and see how heavy
315,315,1293.27,1300.84,7,2,You should be holding this We definitely know that it's
320,320,1318.0,1319.74,7,3,Hmm okay
321,321,1319.58,1325.28,7,1,What about that one but we start from a smaller one we should try that
322,322,1326.0,1330.56,7,1,Yeah you um just keep them but from the small one
323,323,1329.28,1333.31,7,3,Yeah we start from the smallest no uh in your hands
330,330,1362.34,1365.94,7,2,I think it's the same Around the same
331,331,1365.93,1370.95,7,3,Okay how about uh no no uh could you put the blue one back yeah
336,336,1383.63,1386.13,7,1,What was the weight of that
337,337,1385.92,1387.17,7,3,I think this was twenty
346,346,1429.83,1431.84,7,3,Oh uh
347,347,1431.34,1432.09,7,1,Because when
358,358,1473.0,1479.79,7,2,Okay stop stop Because I felt that was heavier you felt that this was heavier So we neeed to
359,359,1477.57,1484.11,7,3,Yeah No uh when you felt it was heavier it was like this three blocks
360,360,1485.09,1490.38,7,2,These four you mean Was it So it means
361,361,1486.36,1494.38,7,3,Uh yeah these four blocks not the green one Yeah So it's between like these two
370,370,1556.0,1572.98,7,3,Yeah I think that is a good idea like we use same weights initially and then add like different Yeah yeah but you need to like keep your eyes closed for that
372,372,1572.67,1576.75,7,2,These are equal this is thirty and this
372,372,1572.67,1576.75,7,2,These are equal this is thirty and this
373,373,1574.56,1577.75,7,1,And we just um mix this together
373,373,1574.56,1577.75,7,1,And we just um mix this together
374,374,1577.27,1581.5,7,3,That is fifty this is twenty yes and this is thirty
378,378,1585.92,1588.17,7,2,Also let's do a combine together
379,379,1587.92,1596.0,7,1,No no just start with these and we add different things until you said they are equal Okay take these two
392,392,1660.09,1664.33,7,1,It doesn'­t feel correct
393,393,1663.59,1666.66,7,3,I don'­t okay so like
396,396,1681.59,1687.59,7,2,And this is Thirty ninety minus thirty sixty
397,397,1683.0,1687.92,7,3,Ten twenty thirty is sixty
409,409,1733.33,1736.11,7,1,It's heavier It's this one
410,410,1734.64,1736.73,7,2,Which one Left one
423,423,1778.64,1786.41,7,3,So uh this is the Nah I think I'm good Yeah we've got like uh
424,424,1780.94,1792.67,7,2,Do you do you want to try it again So this is uh either sixty or or eighty right
424,424,1780.94,1792.67,7,2,Do you do you want to try it again So this is uh either sixty or or eighty right
425,425,1789.47,1794.58,7,3,So twenty plus thirty fifty uh
428,428,1802.59,1805.0,7,2,Because this was heavier that means it has to be eighty
429,429,1802.63,1808.42,7,3,I think so yeah fifty thirty isn't this a hundred
432,432,1815.97,1817.72,7,1,I think we need to add sixty
433,433,1817.17,1819.46,7,2,Sixty or eighty I don'­t know
435,435,1824.0,1824.79,7,2,Do you feel it's the same
436,436,1824.5,1825.68,7,1,It's eighty
439,439,1840.96,1843.68,7,1,I think we should go with ninety and eighty 
440,440,1841.43,1851.75,7,3,We could try first eighty eighty first Okay Yeah Should eighty final okay
452,452,1930.09,1937.84,7,2,One one two three five yeah yeah
453,453,1936.33,1940.67,7,3,Five plus three eight Which is
453,453,1936.33,1940.67,7,3,Five plus three eight Which is
454,454,1938.17,1940.92,7,2,So that should be eight plus five so thirteen
467,467,2025.0,2026.5,7,2,Yeah that was one thirty so it'll be
468,468,2026.47,2029.47,7,1,No I mean this one based on the other
468,468,2026.47,2029.47,7,1,No I mean this one based on the other
469,469,2027.5,2033.5,7,3,This one yeah so one one two three five and then three plus five is eight
