21,21,108.23,111.27,9,1,Definitely not equal
26,26,133.38,135.67,9,1,Look we have the thirty gram block and then
27,27,135.33,136.77,9,3,I think yep
60,60,319.65,321.04,9,2,I'd say it's probably at least one forty
61,61,321.01,321.99,9,1,So one forty
67,67,340.71,342.63,9,3,Let's go with first start with one forty
68,68,341.82,345.51,9,1,Let's do one forty we'll split the difference but not really
73,73,360.33,365.91,9,3,What it's eighty grams I feel like it's 
74,74,361.17,367.17,9,1,Eighty that's not right it's
79,79,394.26,396.17,9,2,Unless they lied like

86,86,424.5,427.38,9,3,Yeah we just have to guess
100,100,481.59,482.92,9,2,Um that's fibonacci series right
101,101,482.83,486.51,9,1,Yeah fibonacci sure yeah seems like fib
103,103,492.66,495.17,9,2,Some mathmatical thing
104,104,493.92,497.7,9,1,Some sort of counting upwards by combining them
109,109,515.43,518.52,9,3,Me neither looks right are you alright
110,110,515.92,520.95,9,1,Looks kind of right yeah I like it
