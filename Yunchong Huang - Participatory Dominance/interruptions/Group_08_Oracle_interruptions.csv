11,11,42.6,47.75,8,3,I mean the fact that it's teetering back and forth it's close enough they're just increments of ten grams
12,12,45.45,48.72,8,1,Yeah so the blue one is thirty
16,16,56.55,64.66,8,2,Did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might
17,17,58.58,64.86,8,1,Did we measure we didn't measure the yellow just keep one
17,17,58.58,64.86,8,1,Did we measure we didn't measure the yellow just keep one
20,20,60.3,73.95,8,2,Let's try both the green ones now I mean both the big ones yeah
33,33,100.05,106.25,8,2,Green green is twenty so green is twenty and then we said this one is thirty right
34,34,100.45,106.77,8,3,Green is twenty ok green is twenty thirty yeah
44,44,155.4,157.66,8,2,It's definitely not staying in between right
45,45,157.58,159.33,8,1,Yeah it's more than forty
48,48,162.82,163.58,8,3,Thirty ok
49,49,163.08,164.88,8,2,Yeah twenty  
61,61,198.15,203.75,8,3,I mean it could be just like how they were placed on like measured at like I don't know
63,63,202.25,204.87,8,2,Like can we use a combination of
64,64,206.83,210.08,8,3,We can't we can't get between so
66,66,209.82,211.22,8,2,So we can move one of these
80,80,248.55,251.25,8,2,Where should we put it then in forty
81,81,249.58,252.9,8,1,I think actually everything is not round figured
123,123,399.92,405.01,8,3,Ok so it might have to do with the numbers and stuff but
125,125,402.01,405.57,8,1,It's like um
126,126,405.84,406.82,8,3,Either that or we could just
127,127,406.75,410.1,8,1,I think it's for data reference I don't know
145,145,475.53,477.08,8,3,I don't want to do math right now
146,146,475.71,479.76,8,1,This has a forty now give me the thirty one
219,219,807.96,809.42,8,1,Yeah we can try eighty
220,220,809.23,810.3,8,2,Right in the middle
222,222,814.02,818.72,8,3,Wait what were the ones that we had on there cause I think that might have been the same
223,223,817.4,820.47,8,1,This this and this ten twenty and fifty
238,238,858.83,860.08,8,3,Oh ok
239,239,860.06,862.35,8,1,It was eighty
269,269,984.96,988.42,8,2,Yeah makes sense cause two tens make up a twenty
270,270,987.73,989.08,8,3,I think you're definitely right
306,306,1235.25,1235.59,8,1,Yeah 
307,307,1235.58,1236.73,8,2,Makes sense
