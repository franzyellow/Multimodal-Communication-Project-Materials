13,13,59.73,61.91,5,3,We're group five
14,14,60.08,64.08,5,1,Alright Reese you can fill out the survey on the end over there ok so we know this is ten grams
14,14,60.08,64.08,5,1,Alright Reese you can fill out the survey on the end over there ok so we know this is ten grams
15,15,62.91,64.62,5,2,So we know this is ten
19,19,74.96,84.46,5,1,What's this one ok so ok so we know that that one's heavier so ok this one looks relatively the same size so should we see
21,21,77.25,85.57,5,3,It's heavy yep
20,20,74.85,79.84,5,2,We just want to go pretty pretty heavy 
21,21,77.25,85.57,5,3,It's heavy yep
21,21,77.25,85.57,5,3,It's heavy yep
23,23,85.25,86.12,5,1,So we could put that there
22,22,85.05,85.92,5,3,Sounds right
23,23,85.25,86.12,5,1,So we could put that there
45,45,164.07,168.25,5,1,Ok so that's heavier ok ok so greather than twenty
46,46,167.06,170.07,5,3,So we have twenty
52,52,184.5,186.08,5,1,Yeah ok so we think purple's thirty
54,54,185.92,187.23,5,2,Purple's thirty
53,53,185.33,186.08,5,3,Purple's thirty
54,54,185.92,187.23,5,2,Purple's thirty
57,57,199.38,200.84,5,1,Thirty twenty
58,58,200.25,201.26,5,2,Plus twenty
62,62,218.73,226.08,5,2,And this is thirty right and this is ten so that would be forty so it's more than forty and less than sixty so it's gotta be fifty
63,63,223.92,229.77,5,1,Less than sixty it's gotta be fifty yeah so ok if we filled this out
62,62,218.73,226.08,5,2,And this is thirty right and this is ten so that would be forty so it's more than forty and less than sixty so it's gotta be fifty
64,64,225.75,226.67,5,3,Yellow fifty
77,77,257.33,259.01,5,1,Yes yeah do you want us to fill it out 
79,79,257.38,259.92,5,3,Yes should I click through it
88,88,294.42,295.75,5,2,I guess we'll just start with the ten
89,89,295.17,297.15,5,1,We'll start with this this is definitely heavier than this
93,93,309.0,311.01,5,3,Cool I would say it's almost twice as heavy
94,94,309.58,314.19,5,1,Ok yeah that's what I was kind of thinking but let's see
104,104,362.07,364.92,5,3,I'm not very good at hand weight but yeah I'd say
105,105,363.92,368.1,5,1,Ok yeah so now   
112,112,397.02,403.25,5,3,Maybe we'll try taking off the lighter of that block and do one ten under and then do that block and do one over
113,113,401.25,405.69,5,1,That's ninety well no well I think this might still be heavier this way
121,121,428.79,431.08,5,3,Yeah I still say brown is
122,122,430.06,432.39,5,1,Add that to that add that
154,154,598.68,609.5,5,1,These are the same this is a difference of ten is this a difference of fifty no it is these and this
155,155,608.67,613.02,5,2,So this plus this equals this 
164,164,652.65,668.33,5,2,I think it's just the extra blocks like having them be seperate blocks just makes it really hard to tell you know which is heavier I only grab by the base right
165,165,658.88,671.13,5,3,I'm trying to do randomization without here spin them for me yep put them right between my fingers
164,164,652.65,668.33,5,2,I think it's just the extra blocks like having them be seperate blocks just makes it really hard to tell you know which is heavier I only grab by the base right
166,166,660.64,671.31,5,1,That didn't work yeah you would have to ok alright
165,165,658.88,671.13,5,3,I'm trying to do randomization without here spin them for me yep put them right between my fingers
166,166,660.64,671.31,5,1,That didn't work yeah you would have to ok alright
168,168,682.74,688.91,5,1,Ok let's go with that let's go with eighty yeah
169,169,683.88,689.4,5,3,I'm not great at handheld weighting cool
182,182,751.86,757.84,5,3,It is actually one one two three five eight one three so you're right it is literally the fibonacci 
183,183,754.67,761.42,5,1,One one yeah it is the fibonacci ok so go with that we're thinking one thirty
187,187,800.13,805.01,5,3,How do you spell Fibonacci F I B O N A C C I
188,188,803.75,805.33,5,2,Fi B O N A C C I
198,198,890.34,900.78,5,3,Equals prior heaviest block plus the one before that so now the equation is mystery block two equals eighty gram plus fifty gram equals one thirty gram cool
199,199,894.52,903.69,5,2,So this one yeah sounds good 
198,198,890.34,900.78,5,3,Equals prior heaviest block plus the one before that so now the equation is mystery block two equals eighty gram plus fifty gram equals one thirty gram cool
200,200,900.75,901.75,5,1,Sure put that in
