## Participatory Dominance

- The original transcripts are in "linguistic data processing" folder;
- My codes grasp "interruptions" and "unsuccessful overlaps" and output them into _interruptions.csv files and _uns_overlap.csv files. They are stored in "interruption" and "uns-overlaps" folders respectively;
- With the same codes two columns of "int" and "uns_ov" are addedto original transcript csv files, those judged by codes to be "int" or "uns_ov" are of value 1,  output them to the "phase_1" folder;
-  Manual labeling for uns_overlaps.csv files and rule out some suspicious ones, those not ruled out are of "passive" label, ruled out ones are with "ruled out" label. I copied them into "uns_overlaps" folder for processing;
-  Based on manual labeled uns_overlaps files I further adjusted "uns_ov" values in phase_1 files  for ruled out ones to 0 by  codes and output them to the "phase_2" folder, these are final files forÂ visualization;
-  Visualization graphs are stored in "visualization" folder.
