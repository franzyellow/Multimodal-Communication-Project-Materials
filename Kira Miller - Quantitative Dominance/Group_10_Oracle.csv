0,3.9,6.4,10,4,Let me Calibrate my cameras real quick Oh I'm just
1,14.67,19.08,10,3,Oh okay
2,7.37,7.65,10,3,Sorry
3,15.38,18.92,10,4,Okay The test that you are completing today is called the weights test The test that you are completing today is called the weights test
4,19.67,23.17,10,4,In part one you will work together to determine the weights of the five colorful cubes
5,24.01,26.75,10,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
6,27.57,30.84,10,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here
7,31.53,42.59,10,4,All of the weights are intervals of ten grams so you don't need to use the slider um and the scale is not perfect so as long as one side doesn't drop you can assume the weights are fairly equal
8,43.52,51.002,10,4,You must place the cubes onto this worksheet once you have determined their weight and also enter their weight in the survey on the computer
9,51.75,54.58,10,4,Uh you can now start the survey You guys are gonna be group number ten
10,55.33,57.08,10,3,Okay so the red is ten grams?
11,57.33,57.4,10,2,Yeah
12,57.59,58.32,10,3,Okay  
13,58.47,59.92,10,1,So I suppose like
14,60.67,65.67,10,1,Let's assume that the bigger ones are 
15,66.58,70,10,2,Let's put two yeah Red one as well
16,68.25,69.5,10,1,We can put that other one here too
17,71.73,72.25,10,3,Hmmm
18,74,74.98,10,2,Too hard a selection
19,78.08,79.06,10,1,Yeah I suppose
20,79.58,82.08,10,3,I guess this is like twenty and this is like ten and ten
21,82.33,82.84,10,2,Hopefully
22,82.97,87.91,10,3,I mean what why didn't we first check out whether these two are equal They are of equal size but
23,85.41,86.17,10,1,Yeah
24,87.41,90.17,10,2,They're the same Uhhhh just don't want to touch it
25,96.5,98,10,3,It looks like they're fairly equal
26,100,101.08,10,2,Yeah I suppose
27,100.84,102.85,10,3,Right so then that's twenty these two are ten
28,104.33,105.32,10,2,Let's see
29,104.59,106.59,10,1,That would make sense to me
30,108.83,110.92,10,2,Just a sec let it settle for the
31,111.42,111.62,10,3,Mmhmm
32,115.17,115.92,10,3,Hmmm
33,117.42,119.17,10,3,Looks fairly equal to me yeah
34,117.46,118.87,10,2,Yeah they're together
35,119.75,128.25,10,3,Alright Well now let's do these two I can already tell this one's heavier yeah
36,119.75,129.84,10,2,Yeah they're they're equal Heavier So let's put the ten one ten
37,123,123.75,10,1,You can just
38,130.33,131.08,10,2,Let's put one ten
39,132.58,133.08,10,2,Let's see
40,136.34,142.91,10,1,I say they are equal Those are the instructions I suppose
41,138.43,139.92,10,2,Yeah fairly equal but let's see
42,142.92,144.13,10,3,We gotta be
43,145.5,146,10,3,Oh
44,146.28,150.25,10,3,Try this one out as well like after some time wait wait wait let's let's see if it balances
45,149.75,150.11,10,2,Yeah
46,151.46,153,10,3,Cause I have a feeling this is a little more
47,157.81,163.33,10,1,I'm not sure was uh just a bit more like we would be able to tell the difference
48,161.42,163.39,10,2,Just a second just a sec
49,166.41,167.67,10,3,Like you would be able to see it right?
50,167.39,170,10,2,Yeah yeah yeah yeah Just a sec
51,171.5,173.26,10,2,Stop now please
52,180.78,202.56,10,2,I'm guessing it's a little bit to the left a little bit to the left like It touches the red line but on the left hand side of the left line red it's gonna be heavier Like not equal but almost almost equal How do wait how do we know this one's twenty did we no we didn't
53,184.06,202.21,10,3,Yeah so let's try to put that on top and see Okay so it's definitely not like fourty Like thirty two thirty three what do you say Cause this one's twenty this one's ten Cause we did it
54,203.33,216.41,10,2,We we moved it and checked the two tens remember we didn't do this one Okay yeah sure sure sure yeah yeah put thirty Thirty yeah
55,207.46,217,10,3,Yeah but then when we have the two yeah Yeah yeah so I would say around thirty two or something
56,208.39,212.15,10,1,To begin with also like we don't really have time to do this
57,217.89,219.78,10,2,Thirty one thirty two so thirty
58,218.23,220.5,10,3,So okay Cool
59,223,225,10,1,Um you know what let's try this
60,224.72,225.48,10,3,What's left
61,228.21,228.74,10,3,Okay  
62,234.11,235.39,10,1,Do these make sense
63,247.61,254.24,10,2,So this one's thirty and what's this one twenty right Twenty okay so this one's gonna be fifty okay
64,250.73,250.83,10,1,Twenty
65,250.75,251.5,10,3,Twenty Yeah
66,260.9,262.41,10,2,Almost there
67,263.83,268.91,10,3,I mean it's not gonna go anywhere I guess it's just Oh
68,265.91,269.13,10,2,It's more tilting to the right so less than fifty
69,270,270.72,10,3,Okay
70,270,274,10,2,But there's no like I mean between weights so fifty
71,274.24,275.81,10,1,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere
72,278.32,281.31,10,2,Just a sec let this settle now Yeah
73,280.08,283.33,10,3,This is gonna be too heavy I think this is around yeah
74,283.84,286.57,10,2,This is like less than fifty less than fifty
75,284.97,285.4,10,3,Fifty
76,286.92,290.71,10,3,Like if those are more than fifty then this is less Yeah
77,289.78,290.41,10,2,Less than fifty
78,295.5,301.5,10,3,I guess we're done huh I just want to feel it though I really want to see if it's the heaviest
79,297.14,297.73,10,1,Makes sense if
80,302.51,307.26,10,3,Should I Oh yeah this is fifty grams 
81,303,305,10,2,Yeah yeah it's it's almost settled down so it's less than fifty
82,307.81,312.48,10,1,So this was thirty right Thirty this was twenty and these are tens
83,309.17,310.42,10,2,Yeah Twenty
84,309.91,310.17,10,3,Okay  
85,312.89,313.67,10,2,and that's fifty
86,313.87,314.17,10,3,Fifty
87,316.91,319.14,10,2,tens yeah So that's it
88,320.47,320.71,10,2,Hopefully
89,320.63,322,10,3,Well we have more weights here
90,322.72,326,10,3,Like one fourty But no blocks
91,323.25,324.18,10,1,This mandate
92,327.82,333.09,10,1,What are we supposed to do we are supposed do We are supposed to enter it in the laptop
93,329.82,334.59,10,3,Do you have more blocks or I think we're done here Oh okay let's do that
94,335.64,336.41,10,2,Ten I guess
95,335.87,337.17,10,3,Group number ten
96,342.68,349,10,3,okay Now help me out Fifty Okay green
97,343.5,350.5,10,2,So the yellow one's fifty Yeah Green wait green's twenty
98,344.52,350.68,10,1,Fifty Yeah Twenty
99,352.82,353.23,10,3,Okay
100,353.34,355.84,10,1,And they're two blue
101,355.32,359.09,10,2,Tens tens are blue blue and red yup
102,359.57,365.67,10,3,blue and reds well they don't have the right uh purple Thirty right yeah alright let's do it
103,361.92,363.41,10,2,Purple's this one thirty
104,366.42,373.25,10,1,you know what like I feel that is this what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right 
105,373.75,382.59,10,3,No I think this is this is the one which is purple Oh
106,374,383.09,10,2,No no no no So like they gave the weight of this one they gave the weight of the red one so that's why they didn't include this one they already gave us yeah
107,376.5,378.5,10,1,There are four options so
108,383.74,386.09,10,3,lets go ahead and hit this
109,387.42,390.67,10,3,red is ten grams  yellow is fifty grams 
110,388.42,389.17,10,2,Yeah red ten given
111,391.12,396.25,10,3,Green is twenty I mean we're we're right right I mean we're exactly right
112,394.25,397,10,2,Uh yeah let's see
113,398.25,403.09,10,3,No the red is ten blue is ten yellow is fifty Okay  
114,399.5,402.33,10,2,Yeah yeah yeah we're we're right
115,405.01,407.59,10,2,Where is the mystery block Any idea
116,407.84,417.67,10,3,Indicate the weight of the mystery block Whoa Where is the blue guy
117,410.18,418.67,10,1,You have two attempts It's heavier than everything else
118,411.17,413.12,10,2,Okay okay we remove the scale
119,414.67,416.42,10,4,Determine the weight of this mystery block 
120,419.67,424.5,10,4,Um you guys will have two attempts to enter the data correctly into the survey
121,422,427.84,10,2,Two attempts okay Wait this one is what again fifty This is this is
122,426.08,426.59,10,3,This is fifty
123,428.82,430.07,10,3,That's that was thirty
124,429.34,430.58,10,1,Thirty Twenty
125,430.59,431.57,10,2,Okay just a sec
126,433.32,443.42,10,2,Can we form something on one side like this place the other one So okay yeah
127,439.15,440.63,10,3,Well just just try to get a feel of It
128,445.5,451.75,10,1,I would say still heavier than all these blocks Yeah can you grab there and hold it
129,447.5,450.84,10,2,Okay really Really
130,449.5,449.75,10,3,Really
131,455.32,456.02,10,2,Just a sec
132,457.59,460.34,10,2,So the yellow one's fifty
133,460.84,463.67,10,2,thirty twenty ten ten okay Just a sec
134,465.42,466.42,10,3,Almost the same
135,468.37,469.5,10,3,Fifty thirty twenty
136,470.5,474.67,10,3,hundred and ten like a hundred or a hundred and ten that would be my guess
137,473.25,475,10,2,Suppose I remove the tens ones then
138,475.5,478.03,10,1,Fifty thirty eighty twenty hundred
139,478.57,488.62,10,2,how are you how are you really holding I'm just moving blocks and seeing Yeah this is lighter this is lighter If I put the ten
140,478.68,479.85,10,3,This is hard to say
141,482.31,484.07,10,1,so like one thirty or one fourty
142,491.17,491.91,10,2,Still lighter
143,492.13,492.58,10,1,Yeah
144,497.23,499,10,2,Comparatively less lighter but
145,499.5,500,10,2,Same
146,502,505.56,10,1,Umm Do you want to try like one thirty
147,502.75,503.25,10,3,Let me try
148,505.06,509.53,10,2,Like like wait let's remove these two let's check This one is lighter right on the right side
149,510.91,511.41,10,2,How's your read
150,512.89,517.92,10,3,It's hard it really it's hard to say because it depends on how strong your hands are both hands so
151,519.25,526.25,10,3,I don't know like ninety or maybe a hundred you know it could be is my guess We have a hundred and ten
152,523,528,10,2,How much is it so we have fifty thirty eighty ten hundred hundred and twenty
153,528.5,535.07,10,2,Because two tens Two tens there's two so the thing is like if we put this also feels lighter right
154,529.58,531.84,10,3,Oh we have two okay Okay
155,536.56,541.42,10,1,Yeah uh maybe not Difficult it is um
156,539.14,542.64,10,2,Maybe not Just a sec okay
157,545.42,546.91,10,2,Yeah it's lighter but this
158,549.9,556.08,10,2,Almost same let's let's do it Yeah 
159,551,551.5,10,3,Okay
160,552.5,555.25,10,1,This is um this whole block is one twenty right so
161,556.28,556.83,10,1,Where do we wanna
162,556.85,561.58,10,3,I think one twenty and one ten would be a good idea because we have two chances
163,561.81,562.08,10,1,Yeah
164,562.39,568.75,10,3,Right Oh okay
165,563.42,569.37,10,1,I I was thinking maybe a little bit higher instead of lower but that also makes sense because I don't know any better
166,571.75,572.5,10,2,see this
167,575,577.25,10,2,This feels same almost try it
168,577,578,10,3,Oh let's try it out
169,581,589.17,10,1,It's strange that like you are saying that all of these stacked up were all identical to that and now these 
170,585.84,586.41,10,2,No no no no
171,586.17,587.67,10,3,Hundred and ten so that's like a hundred
172,589.42,601.34,10,2,No no no no so the thing is like when you put this it feels almost same because it's just ten gram difference that's why Let let's try it Yeah
173,596.5,603.02,10,3,So that that would put it at like a hundred Because that one would be a hundred and ten and this is a hundred ten so that's hundred
174,601.75,604.25,10,1,I mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess
175,606,609.75,10,2,fifty thirty eighty hundred hundred and ten over there
176,610.81,613.78,10,2,hundred and ten yeah let's put hundred and ten let's see what happens
177,614.67,616.41,10,3,Well If we're going to put a hundred and ten What No that's what I said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first I think we should go with a hundred and ten first Then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right
178,615.14,627.57,10,2,No wait wait this is hundred this is hundred this is hundred So means hundred and ten is total this Yeah Okay yeah sure sure sure
179,626.25,626.43,10,1,Yeah
180,630.31,631.24,10,2,Sure let's see
181,635.04,637.63,10,3,Okay this is okay
182,637.65,638.42,10,2,Okay
183,640.89,651.34,10,3,Okay this is not quite correct So between the weights of the prior blocks
184,642.92,650.75,10,1,weights of the prior blocks and use it oh okay So these are ten ten twenty Thirty
185,647.18,647.5,10,2,Prior blocks
186,652.5,666.91,10,1,Fifty it's Fibonacci or something right One one two three five Wait eight eighty maybe Yeah
187,655.31,666.42,10,3,Wait wait what's Two three five eight thirteen twenty Eighty Yeah that's Fibonacci definitely
188,661.08,663.89,10,2,ten ten thirty fifty 
189,667.63,669.41,10,1,Ah I mean that's
190,668.13,677.25,10,2,Ten ten this is what twenty right one plus one two yup two plus one three yup three plus two five oh yeah that's fifty
191,677.75,685.81,10,2,and five plus three eight yeah let's go for eighty then That's a pattern that's it
192,681.34,692.64,10,3,Like just because of just becasuse that's Fibonacci Because I'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights which means
193,686.39,688.16,10,1,Like maybe we can find a pattern
194,692.91,704,10,2,Yeah it's is is there any other series I'm not missing out I mean ten Twenty Thirty Fifty
195,693.27,705.56,10,3,Is that the pattern or is that you know just use those weights Right That that is true anyway And also I mean
196,699.67,702.5,10,1,I'm not sure how far we can get by using the weight
197,706.5,709.5,10,3,We don't really have to be correct I mean we're trying to be correct but
198,711.02,722,10,3,But eighty is a big difference like you know from a hundred to an eighty Well let's try to see if there is a hint here
199,715.17,719.5,10,1,Yeah but also like I can't judge anything by just holding things
200,722.25,726,10,3,This is eight RB I think that that is eighty
201,726.75,727,10,3,I don't know what what's
202,727,728.5,10,1,This is nine RB so
203,730,731.5,10,3,Oh no they don't have any hints here
204,732.81,735.82,10,3,Eighty gram sounds seems like a ninety gram to me but
205,737.02,741.65,10,3,It's cool we have to I guess Eighty alright
206,738.57,740.67,10,2,Eighty let's let's go for eighty Yeah
207,741.89,752.5,10,3,I would go for ninety but you guys are going for eighty Alright Cool Okay
208,745.41,746.67,10,1,I would have gone for one thirty
209,747.5,749.5,10,2,Eighty there you go Yeah
210,753,758,10,4,For the final part of this test read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block
211,758.06,758.34,10,2,What's this
212,758.35,762.31,10,4,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
213,765.12,766.67,10,1,Can you read it out loud or something
214,766.92,771.42,10,3,Well the factory that creates the wooden blocks did not send us the second mystery block 
215,770.9,771.41,10,2,Okay
216,771.68,780.09,10,3,You have two opportunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one two sentences how you determined your estimate Indicate the weight of the second mystery block
217,781.87,792.67,10,1,Fibonacci like let's say That's the first one according to our translate Thirteen one thirty
218,784.03,795.67,10,2,Eight That's the first one So eight plus five Thirteen Yeah there is one thirty Eight plus five
219,784.47,786.52,10,3,Is that the first mystery block or the second mystery block
220,796.75,797.25,10,2,Just do it
221,798.25,799.47,10,3,Wait wait wait a second
