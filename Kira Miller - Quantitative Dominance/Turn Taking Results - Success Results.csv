"Observations:
- The fastest group had one of the largest ranges of conversational dominance, but the second fastest had the smallest
- However, the fastest group with no incorrect guesses had both the largest range in conversational dominance and in overall percentage
- In terms of overall percentage, the faster groups largely had one clear ""leader"" as opposed to slower groups, which were more even between at least two participants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
