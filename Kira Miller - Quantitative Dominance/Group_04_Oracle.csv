0,0.33,4.32,4,4,Ok I'm going to callibrate my cameras
1,11.67,14.1,4,4,I'm sorry I feel like this didn't catch up
2,14.64,16.71,4,4,Ok  
3,21.05,23.97,4,1,I don't know if I have to be serious or not
4,21.5,22.25,4,2,That was awkward
5,24.96,32.4,4,4,So the task you are completing today is called the weights task in the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of the cube
6,33.3,36.24,4,4,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
7,36.78,40.38,4,4,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale provided
8,41.13,45,4,4,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams so you don't need to use the slider
9,45.72,52.8,4,4,Um the scale is not perfect so as long as one side does not drop completely you can assume the weights are fairly equal
10,54.45,56.85,4,4,You must place the weights onto this
11,57.36,68.75,4,4,Place the cubes under the worksheet and then also fill out the survey in line as you go and you can now start oh and you're group four
12,66.41,70.8,4,3,Uh they are not all weight this has more weight oh we're group four so we press enter here
13,64.9,67.66,4,2,Ok so the red has ten
14,72.21,80.64,4,3,Well then no let's compare the red to the blue to see if we can get a baseline to the blue
15,78.08,78.33,4,2,Yeah
16,80.79,83.1,4,1,Well the top is a ten
17,83.58,83.84,4,2,Is it
18,85.12,86.13,4,1,Once it stops
19,89.82,97.32,4,1,Ok there easy so this is twenty yeah cause this is ten as long as it's not dropping it's the same
20,91.67,95.35,4,2,Is it ten and this was equal to this one
21,97.83,99.96,4,1,And then this was
22,103.08,103.67,4,1,Perfect
23,104.58,105.93,4,2,Ok
24,108.33,112.77,4,3,Put the twenty on there take off a ten
25,106.05,110.84,4,1,I feel like this one is oh yeah so this is 
26,110.18,111.34,4,2,Take off a ten
27,116.34,118.32,4,1,So it's not
28,119.94,125.75,4,1,It doesn't drop completely yeah we can consider this to be thirty then yeah because it doesn’t drop
29,123.5,127.41,4,2,Can we yeah and it's obviously not forty
30,124.15,125.03,4,3,Can we
31,127.47,130.62,4,2,Well it's not and it's not twenty yeah it's gotta be thirty
32,127.47,127.75,4,1,Yeah
33,130.65,132.5,4,3,Yeah ok so that's thirty are we writing this down somewhere
34,134.91,136.92,4,4,No you just set the block wherever it goes 
35,132.58,139.95,4,2,Ok can we write on this paper oh well it's a good try to put in our head
36,142.5,145.8,4,4,Um you should be writing it down on the worksheet
37,140.61,142.31,4,2,Wait that oh yeah oh ok
38,142.32,143.25,4,3,And then we want 
39,147.06,151.89,4,1,Oh on there
40,155.04,161.79,4,3,Uh so yellow we or red and blue there's no there's no ok
41,157.84,159.83,4,1,Ok so we can say that this is fifty
42,160.63,161.79,4,2,Not fifty
43,161.88,162.59,4,1,Blue is ten
44,162.59,163.86,4,2,Sixty right 
45,164.67,167.67,4,2,Weren't those both thirty or no only one of them twenty and thirty 
46,165.67,170.31,4,1,No this is twenty you're off the team
47,168.05,169.5,4,3,Twenty and then
48,170.46,177.06,4,3,And so that would mean yellow is fifty
49,170.46,172.25,4,2,I've been cut 
50,175.5,177.06,4,1,Yeah
51,177.87,182.61,4,3,Alright we all happy with that we happy with these solutions
52,178.83,180.41,4,1,This took someone twenty minutes
53,183.06,183.59,4,1,Yeah
54,183.33,186.09,4,2,Yellow is fifty green green is a twenty right
55,184.34,187.35,4,3,Blue's ten green is a twenty
56,187.44,189.17,4,2,Yeah I can see how we can try 
57,187.44,191.04,4,1,Yeah yeah definitely
58,191.46,195.96,4,1,Purple is thirty forty yeah cool they're fifty
59,199.65,200.85,4,3,Hey cool
60,199.02,199.73,4,2,So it's like that 
61,203.1,204.75,4,3,We can see the first part of the task
62,203.1,206.01,4,1,Did um so did
63,209.31,212.34,4,3,Oh there's a new thing without a scale
64,213.51,217.65,4,4,Now you will determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale
65,217.77,219.75,4,4,You will have two attempts to enter the weight correctly
66,220.29,226.71,4,3,Ok I vote here's my vote alright
67,227.07,237.63,4,3,"We each go around, we each come up with a weight ourselves and then we vote then don't look at what we do"
68,230.25,233.84,4,2,Yeah ok I'm not going to look at what you guys do
69,241.38,243.87,4,2,You're just like making out
70,243.93,246.27,4,1,Dude
71,268.32,274.62,4,2,Intrusive thoughts
72,282.15,291.63,4,3,I'm done why is there another block over there
73,297.73,298.75,4,2,Dude what
74,294,296.07,4,1,Block
75,297.9,300.33,4,1,I'll google what it is
76,302.31,306.36,4,2,This is tough this is really tough actually
77,306.96,311.79,4,3,But by voting we get a better chance statistically of being correct
78,311.91,314.34,4,2,True very true
79,318.39,320.76,4,2,How are you holding them like I don't I guess I'll
80,352.44,356.01,4,2,I guess we can watch him can't we
81,356.97,359.31,4,2,No pressure
82,365.31,368.73,4,2,You having fun
83,371.46,373.59,4,1,Friction
84,373.95,380.1,4,3,We get any sort of feedback if we enter any correctly is it higher or lower or are we going to get that wrong
85,381.75,386.33,4,3,Because you said we get two attempts so will we feedback saying we were too high or too low
86,386.33,387.83,4,4,You will get some type of feedback 
87,387.99,390.33,4,3,Ok
88,391.14,394.05,4,3,So in that case we should change our strategy
89,394.11,395.92,4,3,What is the type of feedback we get
90,396.5,397.58,4,2,Probably not supposed to know 
91,410.1,412.38,4,2,Oh interesting
92,418.25,420.75,4,3,I mean we could make a
93,421.71,426.39,4,2,Cheating I think I don't know probably
94,423.94,424.5,4,3,Is it though 
95,428.94,433.92,4,1,Can we use the floor I need a frictionless surface
96,430.51,431.33,4,2,Why don't you just 
97,435.24,438.21,4,1,Is this the same or
98,440.13,442.08,4,2,How are you measuring your force
99,442.09,444.63,4,3,Yeah how are you being exact in your force
100,446.79,450.83,4,1,I just wanted to apply this
101,452.22,454.11,4,2,I mean weight is still physics
102,454.14,456.12,4,1,True  
103,459.51,464.67,4,2,I don't have a good answer just so you know I have like a range of somewhat
104,463.67,465.99,4,3,I have a range as well
105,466.26,468.24,4,1,This one feels best for me
106,468.63,470.61,4,2,Seem I'm between that and all of them
107,470.79,478.47,4,3,I thought it was closer to yellow green and like a red
108,476.4,478.47,4,2,Really ok 
109,478.77,480.83,4,1,No way no way
110,479.58,480.84,4,2,Yeah let me feel that to
111,486.96,494.4,4,2,Yeah no shot no shot I think this is a good way to do it actually side is kind of hard
112,498.19,498.92,4,3,Do that again
113,495.21,499.17,4,3,Yeah you guys are right so if you do
114,499.26,502.17,4,3,I like how we abandoned the voting
115,501.05,504.06,4,2,Well I think I mean we eliminated some like
116,504.48,506.46,4,2,That's where I thought was pretty good
117,507.25,520.74,4,1,This one feels good this one for some reason feels weird yeah I know ok so fifties ten
118,507.15,514.83,4,2,But it's hard to say it makes it look almost lighter well I mean
119,512.08,520.74,4,3,Alright I'm ok with this so that's
120,520.86,523.84,4,3,It would be fifty plus thirty so one ten
121,524.44,526.11,4,2,Yeah this is pretty good
122,527.73,529.09,4,3,We happy with one ten
123,527.73,532.26,4,1,Moment of truth yeah that makes one twenty
124,529.33,531.25,4,2,Yeah I am
125,532.29,534.45,4,2,Yeah
126,534.87,543.06,4,3,It's not quite correct think about the relationship between weights of the prior blocks and use a pattern to determine the weight of the mystery block
127,543.12,553.76,4,3,Ten ten twenty thirty fifty so plus plus it's fibonnaci it's fucking fibonnaci
128,546.55,556.14,4,2,So it's like these these two god
129,549.75,556.14,4,1,Is it fibonacci oh my gosh
130,548.64,564.6,4,3,So ten plus ten is twenty twenty plus ten is thirty thirty plus twenty is fifty so it's eighty so I was fucking right
131,556.53,559.84,4,2,I saw something wasn't there something about fibonacci in the form
132,564.87,569.82,4,1,Yeah I guess so
133,570.24,577.5,4,3,Right my math is right right because thirty plus fifty is then eighty yeah
134,577.59,580.58,4,3,Like ok that would be this and this right like
135,581.38,583.41,4,2,There is weights inserted in here
136,584.04,587.08,4,3,All right are we happy with eighty
137,584.04,586.16,4,2,A cork or something
138,587.12,588.3,4,1,Yeah
139,590.28,597.81,4,2,Oh I did not sorry we even convinced you you were wrong too
140,595.71,597.81,4,3,Yeah you convinced me I was wrong
141,591.32,596.41,4,1,Is it really I guess it was hard to tell because 
142,598.47,605.07,4,1,Oh if we do like this we are like doing a weird balancing act we have to go right in the center of mass
143,605.28,610.37,4,3,Ok please update the worksheet near thefind the research where you completed this portion of the task cool we've completed this portion of the task
144,610.53,620.28,4,4,Ok for the final part of this task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you may now continue
145,620.31,623.46,4,3,The factory creates the wooden blocks
146,623.52,635.92,4,3,Did not send us the second mystery block you have two oppurtunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one to two seconds or one to two sentences how you determined the estimate indicate the weight of the second mystery block
147,635.95,639,4,1,It's gotta be a hundred and thirty if we are doing fibonacci
148,640.35,642.33,4,3,If we're doing fibonnaci yeah sure
149,643.02,644.58,4,3,But that's what they want us to think
150,644.58,646.29,4,1,TRUE
151,646.59,648.57,4,3,It could be
152,651.42,656.92,4,2,What's our sentence going to be we didn't want to follow the pattern because it was too obvious you know what I mean
153,650.7,664.02,4,3,Well I um there's two ends to a pattern right there's the lower end and there's the upper end this is not specifying that the mystery block is heavier
154,664.32,666.48,4,3,The second mystery block could be lighter
155,666.81,676.26,4,3,Oh no it did say that there it did say that there in scales of ten yeah ten is yeah ok oh I'm just trying to
156,668.22,672.17,4,1,Yeah it's gotta be heavier yeah cause
157,667.41,672.25,4,2,It can't yeah because the bottom one is ten x is zero
158,676.68,679.25,4,1,I said one thirty I feel like we can't overthink it
159,679.08,684.48,4,2,I agree one thirty because it follows fibonacci
160,685.92,690.9,4,2,No way caps lock is on a lot
161,690.99,692.34,4,3,How do you spell Fibonacci
162,693.66,695.88,4,2,O N A C C I
163,696,699.6,4,2,Oh that looks pretty good actually there might be two ns
164,700.2,700.44,4,1,No no there's
165,700.82,702.66,4,3,How do you spell Fibonacci
166,702.78,704.76,4,1,I think it's F oh it's that
167,704.97,706.02,4,1,You can also look it up
168,706.01,706.95,4,2,I think this is right yeah
169,707.4,715.44,4,3,I don't know I'm just going to leave it like that it follows Fibonacci because it was eighty plus fifty yeah cool alright we happy with that
170,714.64,715.44,4,1,Yeah
171,715.47,718.14,4,3,Cool alright select one thirty yeah
172,718.38,726,4,3,It is one thirty cool alright we have completed this task
173,721.25,723.75,4,2,We're done with that one
