Utterance,Start,End,Group,Participant,Transcript
0,3.45,7.14,1,4,I just need to calibrate my cameras real quick
1,9.87,12.45,1,4,Alright so
2,12.63,15.75,1,4,The task that you are doing today is called the weights task
3,16.2,21.36,1,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weight of 5 cubes
4,22.17,24.27,1,4,Um and then
5,24.42,27.72,1,4,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams
6,29.08,29.83,1,1,Ok yeah  
7,29.84,31.32,1,4,So uh
8,31.44,34.56,1,4,You don't need to touch the slider on the scale don't worry about that part at all
9,35.01,36.99,1,4,Oh
10,37.83,47.82,1,4,So you have to place sorry please place the scales place the cubes on this worksheet where you prove that they weigh again yes
11,48.27,52.25,1,4,And uh as you are filling it out if you guys can fill out the survey you will be group one
12,52.58,54.84,1,1,Oh and we don't touch the scale yet
13,54.93,58.29,1,4,Um you can touch the scale just like there's a slider
14,58.33,58.84,1,3,It's right there
15,59.22,60.92,1,4,But like you dont need to do anything with the slider
16,60.66,62.49,1,1,Ok so you want us to
17,62.58,65.18,1,1,Use the scale to determine the weights ok cool
18,64.91,69.66,1,4,Yes um and if you guys can fill out that survey like as you go because you'll be submitting answers on there
19,69.81,71.51,1,1,Where's the survey oh ok
20,70.01,70.51,1,3,Um it's turned off
21,72.25,73.53,1,4,Oh
22,75.81,77.17,1,4,And you guys will be group one
23,77.51,77.75,1,2,Ok
24,78.08,80.58,1,1,Ok well it would be nine minus ten
25,78.08,78.58,1,3,One
26,80.58,84.3,1,2,That's ten so then
27,86.07,87.41,1,1,Just like put it on
28,87.48,89.04,1,2,Does the slider move
29,90.12,92.13,1,1,Hold on lets just uh
30,95.19,97.17,1,3,It seems pretty balanced
31,97.56,102.03,1,1,Yeah ok so now we know that this is also ten
32,102.39,105.87,1,1,Um ok so now
33,104.08,104.58,1,2,Ok
34,106.23,110.01,1,1,What would we maybe put that one on there too
35,108.63,109.33,1,2,Cool
36,110.16,114.24,1,1,And then see if there's thats twenty which is not
37,112.16,112.92,1,2,It's more
38,114.87,120.33,1,1,Lets try this one oh gee louise this one
39,117.41,118.25,1,3,No  
40,121.2,125.01,1,1,Ok lets just oops sorry
41,127.35,132,1,2,Ok so this one is probably twenty ten ten twenty
42,128.83,130.08,1,3,Yeah seems about twenty
43,128.41,130.75,1,1,Ok so ten ten twenty
44,132.27,139.65,1,1,Ok so now lets start at thirty alright put one of those on there
45,135.33,135.91,1,3,Yes  
46,135.73,136.41,1,2,Yeah thirty
47,140.73,145.89,1,1,Ooh its looking like thirty
48,142.91,144.92,1,2,Probably thirty at this point
49,148.86,159.42,1,1,Ok so we got ok yeah this one is really heavy so lets do the a this and a ten
50,149.25,154.25,1,2,Yeah ten ten twenty thirty
51,153.21,155.25,1,3,Twenty thirty forty
52,159.6,163.86,1,3,So fourty pounds
53,162.91,163.86,1,1,Yeah
54,164.37,167.91,1,3,Fifty pounds or pounds grams
55,169.31,171.99,1,1,Interesting so that's ten twenty
56,172.56,183.58,1,1,So we said this ones thirty I still feel like that's heavier and this one is twenty
57,174.54,185.08,1,2,Yeah yeah the blue dark blue one is thirty that's the larger one it's slightly heavier yeah
58,185.33,187.83,1,3,We can replace one of these with the twenty to get
59,188.1,189.5,1,3,Sixty here
60,189.91,196.44,1,1,Ok and then put that on that one
61,198.15,202.14,1,2,How much is the dark blue small one ten
62,200.31,201.37,1,1,Ten they're both
63,203.49,204.34,1,1,Assuming that this was
64,204.58,206.37,1,2,Oh gosh I think I got them mixed up
65,207.06,210.87,1,1,Yeah Im thinking that it's ten ten twenty thirty
66,211.29,213.93,1,1,So what have we done weve done forty
67,214.47,216.45,1,1,Um
68,216.63,219.06,1,1,And then we did fifty
69,216.16,217.66,1,2,It's just like slightly 
70,219.33,221.49,1,1,And then we did sixty
71,228.06,231.51,1,1,And now it stopped being too heavy
72,231.54,233.52,1,1,So this is supposedly
73,234.27,239.82,1,1,Thirty fourty fifty correct and it's still heavier than this thing
74,235.83,237.58,1,2,Fifty yeah
75,240.84,242.82,1,1,So have we done forty
76,251.88,258.72,1,1,So thirty this is also forty right so this if forty yeah
77,254.63,255.31,1,2,Ok so that one's twenty right
78,256.84,257.01,1,3,Yes
79,260.01,263.82,1,1,This is fifty it's not 
80,264.93,267.36,1,1,Yo that's close enough ok so
81,268.08,272.58,1,3,Yeah fifty so we say yellow is fifty
82,267.57,269.42,1,1,Fifty boom
83,274.26,280.32,1,3,And green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple
84,275.75,279.11,1,2,Yeah
85,275.83,277.75,1,1,I think that's I think that's good
86,281.25,283.48,1,2,I think this one is purple and this one is blue
87,282.25,286.26,1,3,Ok so blue is ten and purple is 
88,286.56,287.08,1,3,Thirty
89,288.92,292.47,1,1,Yes verify real quick but I think it is
90,288.91,289.41,1,2,Yes thirty
91,295.32,304.62,1,1,Yeah we got them yeah
92,296.48,296.79,1,2,Yeah
93,295.66,302.75,1,3,Yes do you want to check real quick
94,304.68,305.58,1,1,That looks good to me
95,304.48,306.03,1,2,Seems about right to me
96,305.91,307.2,1,3,Ok
97,308.28,312.3,1,1,Uh blue yeah so you said purple sweet
98,312.93,315.42,1,2,Purple is thirty red is twenty yellow is fifty
99,313.82,314.42,1,1,You're right
100,315.66,315.91,1,3,Cool
101,318.72,321.81,1,1,Ok we have finished and we were correct
102,321.84,323.97,1,4,Ok awesome um
103,324.12,339.63,1,4,You are now going to determine the weight of this block without the scale you will have two attempts to get the weight correctly
104,331.17,331.83,1,3,Oh
105,334.38,336.33,1,1,Ok definitely minimum fifty
106,337.08,337.92,1,2,Minimum fifty
107,339.87,341.85,1,4,And you can now continue
108,342.06,347.07,1,1,Yeah cause if you feel the yellow one oh yeah so yeah
109,344.01,347.07,1,3,Do we get a glass of water
110,350.73,351.67,1,2,Definitely heavier
111,351.31,351.75,1,1,Yeah
112,351.65,352.71,1,3,Yeah
113,354.36,359.76,1,1,Ok so we got this ok
114,361.23,365.07,1,1,Ooh that seems pretty good pretty close to me
115,365.49,367.98,1,2,How much was purple thirty
116,368.7,369.42,1,2,Purple was thirty
117,369.91,370.68,1,3,Yeah
118,370.86,372.84,1,2,And yellow was fifty
119,373.89,380.58,1,1,Yeah try picking these two up and you can close your eyes and try to hold it from the
120,374.64,375.25,1,3,Which would put eighty
121,381.48,383.61,1,1,Yeah same point maybe
122,383.7,384.33,1,1,I don't know its hard
123,385.08,388.41,1,3,I almost feel like this one is still heavier
124,394.62,399.66,1,2,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think
125,402.81,406.89,1,2,It still feels heavier but it could just be
126,407.58,410.37,1,3,It is definitely denser which could be skewing
127,410.52,412.5,1,3,Our perception of it
128,413.43,414.58,1,2,So right now that's ninety grams
129,414.91,415.83,1,1,Oh jeez yeah
130,416.76,420.03,1,1,And na that's freaking that's way
131,420.96,423.39,1,2,That's a hundred
132,423.87,430.47,1,1,Yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe
133,432.66,435.72,1,2,That does feel pretty similar give it a shot
134,440.4,442.53,1,3,Yeah I think its
135,442.68,448.16,1,3,It feels really similar and that's a hundred grams
136,443.66,454.47,1,1,Yeah that's a good first guess and we get two so do you think we should a consensus on that one and this is fifty
137,448.91,450.5,1,2,Let's do it yeah a hundred I think
138,455.37,459.27,1,2,Thirty twenty right ok yeah
139,455.37,457.5,1,1,Thirty twenty
140,460.26,464.28,1,1,Uh yeah so should we press the blue arrow
141,464.64,473.25,1,3,We're on this screen right now should we go onto the next one ok
142,467.91,473.25,1,1,The current weight of the last that was our first test ok
143,470.75,472.01,1,4,Oh yeah you can continue
144,473.37,479.88,1,3,Two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok
145,473.45,479.88,1,1,Ok a hundred ok 
146,481.71,485.94,1,1,That was not quite correct ok
147,487.11,489.69,1,3,I think it's more if it's anything
148,488.16,489.69,1,2,I think you're thinking more
149,491.07,493.59,1,3,That's less right now
150,493.72,495.42,1,2,Is that less right now oh
151,495.72,498.01,1,1,Oh yeah that is where we were at
152,498.5,521.25,1,2,We were at this yet ok
153,500.16,502.83,1,3,No that's a hundred and ten
154,505.68,511.29,1,1,The thing that sucks is that now we are finding about like torque and different other
155,504.9,505.5,1,2,Ooh
156,511.32,514.47,1,1,Perceptions of uh
157,517.02,519.24,1,2,I still think the brown one is heavier than this
158,525,526.13,1,2,It's hard to balance them
159,526.33,527.58,1,3,Yeah
160,533.01,537.3,1,1,I wonder like I don't know what that one
161,538.17,541.44,1,1,God yeah balances is hard I mean
162,539.83,540.22,1,2,Yeah
163,541.74,545.94,1,1,So I think definitely it's either
164,546.21,554.52,1,1,This or this cause we can't even make these weights so it could be above them I know but like if we are thinking it's so close to a hundred
165,549.41,550.5,1,3,That could be part of it
166,555.57,559.58,1,1,Are probably errors within yeah within this
167,557.58,558.66,1,3,Twenty  
168,559.08,561.69,1,2,I just like tried to put all the cubes in my hand at once
169,562.08,563.41,1,2,No that doesn't do anything
170,563.42,565.26,1,1,So would you
171,565.59,574.71,1,2,I would say either a hundred twenty or a hundred thirty because I feel like it would be possible for it to be out of range of what we can measure but
172,574.92,576.9,1,1,Yeah
173,578.88,582.09,1,1,Yeah it's just weird
174,589.86,602.07,1,1,I don't know I guess I would I would vote one of these two but what do you guys think ok
175,598.5,600.5,1,2,Between the two I would say a hundred twenty
176,603.9,608.64,1,3,It feels close I just can't tell if like
177,609,612.75,1,2,So right now this is one-twenty
178,610.5,611.08,1,3,One twenty
179,618.81,623.4,1,1,Do you want to try one twenty then
180,623.43,628.02,1,2,Yeah it's either one twenty or one thirty for me so I think one twenty would be the best guess
181,630.57,641.28,1,1,Eighty grams wow yes cause margin of error interesting
182,632.23,638.08,1,3,What hey hey we were right about our margin of error of twenty we were just thinking in the wrong direction 
183,641.79,645.92,1,1,Yeah there's it's gotta be something to do with the verticality of this but yeah we failed
184,646.25,647.15,1,3,Yeah
185,650.41,652.35,1,4,Um ok so  
186,652.65,655.02,1,4,For the final part of the task
187,655.17,666.21,1,4,Read the scenario that will come up for the next part of the survey and estimate the weight of the next block and you will again have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer
188,666.24,669,1,4,And you can now continue the survey
189,677.16,679.14,1,1,They didn't send us the next block
190,679.23,686.61,1,1,So we ok let's see the second mystery block
191,686.94,692.37,1,1,Two oppurtunites to estimate the weight of the second block explain one
192,689.91,690.92,1,3,It's the fibonacci series
193,694.98,697.29,1,1,That's twenty ok um
194,697.32,701.34,1,1,Explain in one to two sentence what I determined
195,702.21,707.07,1,1,Ok ok yeah so we got one one two
196,704.75,706.25,1,3,Yeah it's the fibonacci series
197,707.37,712.26,1,1,Three three plus two is five five plus two
198,712.75,717.67,1,2,Eight eight plus five is one hundred thirty
199,712.62,723.9,1,1,Wow wait so one thirty ok
200,718.91,719.91,1,3,Yeah
201,724.11,726.92,1,3,Um I have no idea how to spell Fibonacci
202,727.25,729.42,1,1,F I B B or 
203,729.69,731.79,1,1,It's F I B O
204,732.75,739.02,1,1,And then N N or N A C C I yeah I need to resee it 
205,734.83,737.25,1,2,N A C C I I think so yeah
206,738.16,738.42,1,3,Yeah
207,739.53,741.51,1,1,Yeah
208,743.28,745.62,1,1,Pattern was recognized I guess
209,748.38,751.83,1,2,Can't be like three other patterns that people can do
210,752.02,753.45,1,3,Yeah
211,754.77,757.89,1,1,Um yeah let's I think that's fine
212,760.41,771.36,1,1,It was wow ok we we got that one correct because of mister power work I don't know what I would have done at first to be honest 
213,760.58,764.58,1,2,Yeah that was a good thought
214,752.25,774.39,1,2,Yeah no I wouldn't have thought of that
215,780.15,783.54,1,1,That's why you need three minds
216,782.02,783.4,1,3,Yeah
217,785.97,786.66,1,1,Eighty grams  
218,786.5,787.8,1,2,Yeah I was thinking
